Using impeccable Darwinian logic and elaborating, extending and adding to the classic theoretical contributions of pioneers of behavioral and evolutionary ecology like George Williams, William Hamilton and Robert Trivers, Alexander developed the most detailed and comprehensive vision of human social evolution of his era. His ideas and hypotheses have inspired countless biologists, anthropologists, psychologists and other social scientists to explore the evolution of human social behavior in ever greater detail, and many of his seminal ideas have stood the test of time and come to be pillars of our understanding of human social evolution. This volume presents classic papers or chapters by Dr. Alexander, each focused on an important theme from his work. Introductions by Dr. Alexander's former students and colleagues highlight the importance of his work to the field, describe more recent work on the topic, and discuss current issues of contention and interest.},

  abstract = {KCC2 is a neuron specific K+-Cl- co-transporter that controls neuronal chloride homeostasis, and is critically involved in many neurological diseases including brain trauma, epilepsies, autism and schizophrenia. Despite significant accumulating data on the biology and electrophysiological properties of KCC2, structure-function relationships remain poorly understood. Here we used calixarene detergent to solubilize and purify wild-type non-aggregated and homogenous KCC2. Specific binding of inhibitor compound VU0463271 was demonstrated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Mass spectrometry revealed glycosylations and phosphorylations as expected from functional KCC2. We show by electron microscopy (EM) that KCC2 exists as monomers and dimers in solution. Monomers are organized into ``head'' and ``core'' domains connected by a flexible ``linker''. Dimers are asymmetrical and display a bent ``S-shape'' architecture made of four distinct domains and a flexible dimerization interface. Chemical crosslinking in reducing conditions shows that disulfide bridges are involved in KCC2 dimerization. Moreover, we show that adding a tag to the C-terminus is detrimental to KCC2 function. We postulate that the conserved KCC2 C-ter may be at the interface of dimerization. Taken together, our findings highlight the flexible multi-domain structure of KCC2 with variable anchoring points at the dimerization interface and an important C-ter extremity providing the first in-depth functional architecture of KCC2.},

To this end, we adapted and further optimized two-photon fluorescence correlation microscopy (TPFCM) for in vivo measurement of transport parameters in tumors. TPFCM extends the detectable range of diffusion coefficients in tumors by one order of magnitude, and reveals both a fast and a slow component of diffusion. The ratio of these two components depends on molecular size and can be altered in vivo with hyaluronidase and collagenase. These studies indicate that TPFCM is a promising tool to dissect the barriers to drug delivery in tumors.},

  abstract = {GABA release during cerebral energy deprivation (produced by anoxia or ischemia) has been suggested either to be neuroprotective, because GABA will hyperpolarize neurons and reduce release of excitotoxic glutamate, or to be neurotoxic, because activation of GABAA receptors facilitates Cl\textendash{} entry into neurons and consequent cell swelling. We have used the GABAA receptors of hippocampal area CA1 pyramidal cells to sense the rise of [GABA]o occurring in simulated ischemia. Ischemia evoked, after several minutes, a large depolarization to {$\sim$}\textendash 20 mV. Before this ``anoxic depolarization,'' there was an increase in GABA release by exocytosis (spontaneous IPSCs). After the anoxic depolarization, there was a much larger, sustained release of GABA that was not affected by blocking action potentials, vesicular release, or the glial GABA transporter GAT-3 but was inhibited by blocking the neuronal GABA transporter GAT-1. Blocking GABAA receptors resulted in a more positive anoxic depolarization but decreased cell swelling at the time of the anoxic depolarization. The influence of GABAA receptors diminished in prolonged ischemia because glutamate release evoked by the anoxic depolarization inhibited GABAA receptor function by causing calcium entry through NMDA receptors. These data show that ischemia releases GABA initially by exocytosis and then by reversal of GAT-1 transporters and that the resulting Cl\textendash{} influx through GABAA receptor channels causes potentially neurotoxic cell swelling.},

  abstract = {Previous research has led to the idea that derived traits can arise through the evolution of novel roles for conserved genes. We explored whether Neuropeptide Y-like signaling, a conserved pathway that regulates food-related behavior, is involved in a derived, nutritionally-related trait, division of labor in worker honey bees. Transcripts encoding two NPY-like peptides were expressed in separate populations of brain neurosecretory cells, consistent with endocrine functions. NPY-related genes were upregulated in the brains of older foragers compared to younger bees performing brood care (``nurses''). A subset of these changes can be attributed to nutrition, but NPF peptide treatments did not influence sugar intake. These results contrast with recent reports of more robust associations between division of labor and the related insulin-signaling pathway and suggest that some elements of molecular pathways associated with feeding behavior may be more evolutionarily labile than others.},

In silico analysis showed that while exon 22 of KCC2 is unique to this isoform in therian mammals, it is retained in KCC2's closest paralog, KCC4, of lower vertebrates, including chicken. To eliminate potential cross-reactivity with chicken KCC4, the antibodies were preadsorbed with blocking peptides prepared over the only two regions showing significant sequence identity to chicken KCC4. This completely eliminated antibody recognition of exogenously expressed chicken KCC4 but not of the {$\sim$}145-kDa protein in chicken heart, indicating that chicken heart expresses KCC2. Real-time PCR confirmed robust KCC2 transcript expression in both chicken brain and heart. Chicken heart expressed predominantly the longer KCC2a splice variant consistent with the larger {$\sim$}145-kDa protein in chicken heart. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed prominent plasma membrane KCC2 labeling in chicken ventricular cardiomyocytes. We hypothesize that KCC2 is an important Cl- extrusion pathway in avian cardiomyocytes that counters channel-mediated Cl- loading during high heart rates with {$\beta$}-adrenergic stimulation. While KCC2 is absent from mammalian cardiomyocytes, understanding the role that the other KCC isoforms play in Cl- homeostasis of these cells represents a nascent area of research.},

HA breakdown is a feature of the acute stage of stroke injury and may be detrimental through enhancement of the inflammatory response. Recent studies had shown that knockout mice lacking hyaluronic acid synthetase demonstrates epileptic phenotype in vivo and removal of HA leads to delayed development of epileptiform activity in cultured hippocampal neurons in vitro. Here we studied if digestion of hyaluronic acid in hippocampus in early postnatal period can trigger seizures. Hyaluronidase (Hyal) (5 U/\textmu l) was bilaterally injected into C57BL/6j mice (P17) CA1 field of hippocampus using stereotaxic method to remove hyaluronan-based extracellular matrix. Transcriptome analysis of hippocampal tissue 2 h after enzymatic digestion of hyaluronan-based brain extracellular matrix revealed increased gene expression of proteins involved in inflammation reactions (TLR2, CCL2,3,5), neuroinflammation, axonal guidance and ephrin receptor signaling versus the vehicle group. Mice injected with hyaluronidase exhibited delayed audiogenic seizures, improvement in working memory at the time point 72 hour after injection while there were no changes in locomotor activity, anxious level and exploratory behavior due to the open field test. The obtained results point to a link between the activation of neuroinflammation by enzymatic digestion of hyaluronan-based brain extracellular matrix during the neonatal period and their subsequent reactivity to seizures, which may play an important role in the functional features of the developing brain, including its seizure propensity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
WNK kinases, including WNK3, and the associated downstream SPAK and OSR1 kinases, comprise an important signaling cascade that regulates the cation-chloride cotransporters. Ischemia-induced stimulation of the bumetanide-sensitive Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of experimental stroke, but the mechanism of its regulation in this context is unknown. Here, we investigated the WNK3-SPAK/OSR1 pathway as a regulator of NKCC1 stimulation and their collective role in ischemic brain damage.

METHOD
Wild-type WNK3 (WT) and WNK3 knockout (KO) mice were subjected to ischemic stroke via transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Infarct volume, brain edema, blood brain barrier (BBB) damage, white matter demyelination, and neurological deficits were assessed. Total and phosphorylated forms of WNK3 and SPAK/OSR1 were assayed by immunobloting and immunostaining. In vitro ischemia studies in cultured neurons and immature oligodendrocytes were conducted using the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation method.

RESULTS
WNK3 KO mice exhibited significantly decreased infarct volume and axonal demyelination, less cerebral edema, and accelerated neurobehavioral recovery compared to WNK3 WT mice subjected to MCA occlusion. The neuroprotective phenotypes conferred by WNK3 KO were associated with a decrease in stimulatory hyper-phosphorylations of the SPAK/OSR1 catalytic T-loop and of NKCC1 stimulatory sites Thr203/Thr207/Thr212, as well as with decreased cell surface expression of NKCC1. Genetic inhibition of WNK3 or siRNA knockdown of SPAK/OSR1 increased the tolerance of cultured primary neurons and oligodendrocytes to in vitro ischemia.

CONCLUSION
These data identify a novel role for the WNK3-SPAK/OSR1-NKCC1 signaling pathway in ischemic neuroglial injury, and suggest the WNK3-SPAK/OSR1 kinase pathway as a therapeutic target for neuroprotection following ischemic stroke.},

I propose that this mechanism provides a solution to the problem of how to excite developing neurons to promote growth and synapse formation while avoiding the potentially toxic effects of a mismatch between GABA-mediated inhibition and glutamatergic excitation. As key elements of this cascade are activity dependent, the formation of inhibition adds an element of nurture to the construction of cortical networks.},

One of the most investigated examples is the developmentally regulated shift of actions of the transmitter GABA that inhibit adult neurons but excite immature ones because of an initially higher intracellular chloride concentration [Cl-]i, leading to depolarizing and often excitatory actions of GABA instead of hyperpolarizing and inhibitory actions. The levels of [Cl-]i are also highly labile, being readily altered transiently or persistently by enhanced episodes of activity in relation to synaptic plasticity or a variety of pathological conditions, including seizures and brain insults. Among the plethora of channels, transporters, and other devices involved in controlling [Cl-]i, two have emerged as playing a particularly important role: the chloride importer NKCC1 and the chloride exporter KCC2. Here, the authors stress the importance of determining how [Cl-]i is dynamically regulated and how this affects brain operation in health and disease. In a clinical perspective, agents that control [Cl-]i and reinstate inhibitory actions of GABA open novel therapeutic perspectives in many neurological disorders, including infantile epilepsies, autism spectrum disorders, and other developmental disorders.},

  abstract = {The developing brain is talkative but its language is not that of the adult. Most if not all voltage and transmitter-gated ionic currents follow a developmental sequence and network-driven patterns differ in immature and adult brains. This is best illustrated in studies engaged almost three decades ago in which we observed elevated intracellular chloride (Cl-)i levels and excitatory GABA early during development and a perinatal excitatory/inhibitory shift. This sequence is observed in a wide range of brain structures and animal species suggesting that it has been conserved throughout evolution. It is mediated primarily by a developmentally regulated expression of the NKCC1 and KCC2 chloride importer and exporter respectively. The GABAergic depolarization acts in synergy with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated and voltage-gated calcium currents to enhance intracellular calcium exerting trophic effects on neuritic growth, migration and synapse formation. These sequences can be deviated in utero by genetic or environmental insults leading to a persistence of immature features in the adult brain. This ``neuroarcheology'' concept paves the way to novel therapeutic perspectives based on the use of drugs that block immature but not adult currents. This is illustrated notably with the return to immature high levels of chloride and excitatory actions of GABA observed in many pathological conditions. This is due to the fact that in the immature brain a down regulation of KCC2 and an up regulation of NKCC1 are seen. Here, I present a personal history of how an unexpected observation led to novel concepts in developmental neurobiology and putative treatments of autism and other developmental disorders. Being a personal account, this review is neither exhaustive nor provides an update of this topic with all the studies that have contributed to this evolution. We all rely on previous inventors to allow science to advance. Here, I present a personal summary of this topic primarily to illustrate why we often fail to comprehend the implications of our own observations. They remind us \textendash{} and policy deciders \textendash{} why Science cannot be programed, requiring time, and risky investigations that raise interesting questions before being translated from bench to bed.

  abstract = {Burrow, soil surface and ambient temperatures were compared in mesic and xeric climates in tropical and sub-tropical Africa. In all the areas studied there was a similar daily pattern of change in the temperature of the soil surface and the burrow air but the magnitude of the changes and the time of day at which maximal and minimal temperatures occurred varied. In all areas, changes in burrow temperature were of a lower amplitude than those above ground. Mean monthly subsoil temperatures show that the annual amplitude of temperature fluctuation is greatest at the soil surface and diminishes with increasing depth. At depths greater than 0,6 m mean annual soil temperatures vary minimally. The depth at which this occurs is to some extent dependent upon soil type and ground cover. The mean daily burrow temperatures also show that the daily amplitude of temperature fluctuation is less with increasing depth. The subtropics show marked seasonal changes in mean burrow and above-ground temperatures whereas the available information in the literature shows that little seasonality occurs in the tropics. We suggest that this regional difference in temperature profiles may lead to the seasonality in breeding and in moulting shown by rodent moles from the subtropics and for the absence of this seasonality in rodent moles from the tropics.},

  abstract = {Visual scoring of murine EEG signals is time-consuming and subject to low inter-observer reproducibility. The Racine scale for behavioral seizure severity does not provide information about interictal or sub-clinical epileptiform activity. An automated algorithm for murine EEG analysis was developed using total signal variation and wavelet decomposition to identify spike, seizure, and other abnormal signal types in single-channel EEG collected from kainic acid-treated mice. The algorithm was validated on multi-channel EEG collected from {$\gamma$}-butyrolacetone-treated mice experiencing absence seizures. The algorithm identified epileptiform activity with high fidelity compared to visual scoring, correctly classifying spikes and seizures with 99\% accuracy and 91\% precision. The algorithm correctly identifed a spike-wave discharge focus in an absence-type seizure recorded by 36 cortical electrodes. The algorithm provides a reliable and automated method for quantification of multiple classes of epileptiform activity within the murine EEG and is tunable to a variety of event types and seizure categories.},

  abstract = {The Dependable Warmer
During the middle of the Eocene, about 40 million years ago, a transient warming event interrupted the long-term cooling trend that had been in progress for the previous 10 million years. Bijl et al. (p. 819; see the Perspective by Pearson) constructed records of sea surface temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations across the warming period. It appears that vast amounts of CO2 were injected into the atmosphere, and a sea surface temperature increase of as much a 6\textdegree C accompanied the atmospheric CO2 rise.
The long-term warmth of the Eocene (\textasciitilde 56 to 34 million years ago) is commonly associated with elevated partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO2). However, a direct relationship between the two has not been established for short-term climate perturbations. We reconstructed changes in both pCO2 and temperature over an episode of transient global warming called the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO; \textasciitilde 40 million years ago). Organic molecular paleothermometry indicates a warming of southwest Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) by 3\textdegree{} to 6\textdegree C. Reconstructions of pCO2 indicate a concomitant increase by a factor of 2 to 3. The marked consistency between SST and pCO2 trends during the MECO suggests that elevated pCO2 played a major role in global warming during the MECO.
Elevated concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide played a major role in a global warming event during the Middle Eocene.

The versatility of CCC gene transcription, posttranslational modification, and trafficking are on par with what is known about ion channels. The cell-specific and subcellular expression patterns of different CCC isoforms have a key role in modifying a neuron's electrophysiological phenotype during development, synaptic plasticity, and disease. While having a major role in controlling responses mediated by GABAA and glycine receptors, CCCs also show close interactions with glutamatergic signaling. A cross-talk among CCCs and trophic factors is important in short-term and long-term modification of neuronal properties. CCCs appear to be multifunctional proteins that are also involved in shaping neuronal structure at various stages of development, from stem cells to synaptogenesis. The rapidly expanding work on CCCs promotes our understanding of fundamental mechanisms that control brain development and functions under normal and pathophysiological conditions.},

  abstract = {Hyaluronan (HA) is a simple but diverse glycosaminoglycan. It plays a major role in aging, cellular senescence, cancer and tissue homeostasis. In which way HA affects the surrounding tissues depends on the molecular weight of HA. Whereas high molecular weight HA is associated with homeostasis and protective effects, HA fragments tend to be linked to the pathologic state. Furthermore, the interaction of HA with its binding partners, the hyaladherins, like CD44, is essential for sustaining tissue integrity and is likewise related to cancer. The naked mole rat, a rodent species, possesses a special form of very high molecular weight HA, which is associated to the extraordinary cancer resistance and longevity of those animals. This review addresses HA and its diverse facets: from HA synthesis to degradation, from oligomeric HA to very high molecular weight HA and from its beneficial properties to the involvement in pathologies. We further discuss the functions of HA in the naked mole rat and compare them to human conditions. Though intensively researched, this simple polymer bears some secrets that may hold the key for a better understanding of cellular processes and the development of diseases, such as cancer.},

  abstract = {Many studies analyzing interactions of pH and bioelectric activity focus on changes of the extracellular pH, whereas data concerning central neuronal excitability and intracellular pH (pHi) are rare. Here, we report on the spontaneous bioelectric activity and epileptiform activity of CA3-neurons during a procedure which changed pHi. As monitored in BCECF-AM loaded cells, the change from a CO2/HCO3--buffered to a HEPES-buffered medium (CO2/HCO3--withdrawal, hereafter termed W) was associated with a transient intracellular alkalosis ({$\Delta$}pH=0.2{$\pm$}0.04) which preceded a sustained intracellular acidosis ({$\Delta$}pH=0.4{$\pm$}0.04). Coinciding with this W-induced biphasic shift of pHi a biphasic alteration of spontaneous bioelectric activity was recorded: as a rule, an up to 30 min lasting increase (excitatory phase) preceded a typical sustained suppression (inhibitory phase). This biphasic action was also observed using various in vitro-epilepsy-models (bicuculline, penicillin, caffeine): epileptiform discharges were completely suppressed after an initial increase in frequency. This modulation of bioelectric activity was unlikely due to alterations of the postsynaptic GABA-system as hyperpolarizing GABAA- and GABAB-responses of CA3-neurons were hardly affected. In the majority of the neurons, the initial increase of spontaneous bioelectric activity (excitatory phase) culminated in transient burst periods lasting 5\textendash 30 min. These transient burst periods were blocked by NMDA- or AMPA-antagonists: dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV, 50 {$\mu$}M) or 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 50 {$\mu$}M). The calcium-antagonist verapamil (50 {$\mu$}M) reduced amplitudes of depolarizations and duration of the transient burst periods. The results suggest that the biphasic alteration of pHi modulates the susceptibility of glutamate receptors and voltage-gated calcium-channels, which leads to respective changes of bioelectric activity.},

A reduction of KCC2 expression or function is implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders, including spasticity and chronic pain following spinal cord injury (SCI). Given the critical role of KCC2 in regulating the strength and robustness of inhibition, identifying tools that may increase KCC2 function and, hence, restore endogenous inhibition in pathological conditions is of particular importance. We show that activation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) type 2A receptors to serotonin hyperpolarizes the reversal potential of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), EIPSP, in spinal motoneurons, increases the cell membrane expression of KCC2 and both restores endogenous inhibition and reduces spasticity after SCI in rats. Up-regulation of KCC2 function by targeting 5-HT2A receptors, therefore, has therapeutic potential in the treatment of neurological disorders involving altered chloride homeostasis. However, these receptors have been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, and their effects on pain processing are controversial, highlighting the need to further investigate the potential systemic effects of specific 5-HT2AR agonists, such as (4-bromo-3,6-dimethoxybenzocyclobuten-1-yl)methylamine hydrobromide (TCB-2).},

  abstract = {The incidence of seizures is particularly high in the early ages of life. The immaturity of inhibitory systems, such as GABA, during normal brain development and its further dysregulation under pathological conditions that predispose to seizures have been speculated to play a major role in facilitating seizures. Seizures can further impair or disrupt GABAA signaling by reshuffling the subunit composition of its receptors or causing aberrant reappearance of depolarizing or hyperpolarizing GABAA receptor currents. Such effects may not result in epileptogenesis as frequently as they do in adults. Given the central role of GABAA signaling in brain function and development, perturbation of its physiological role may interfere with neuronal morphology, differentiation, and connectivity, manifesting as cognitive or neurodevelopmental deficits. The current GABAergic antiepileptic drugs, while often effective for adults, are not always capable of stopping seizures and preventing their sequelae in neonates. Recent studies have explored the therapeutic potential of chloride cotransporter inhibitors, such as bumetanide, as adjunctive therapies of neonatal seizures. However, more needs to be known so as to develop therapies capable of stopping seizures while preserving the age- and sex-appropriate development of the brain.},

  abstract = {This review summarizes the brain mechanisms controlling sleep and wakefulness. Wakefulness promoting systems cause low-voltage, fast activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Multiple interacting neurotransmitter systems in the brain stem, hypothalamus, and basal forebrain converge onto common effector systems in the thalamus and cortex. Sleep results from the inhibition of wake-promoting systems by homeostatic sleep factors such as adenosine and nitric oxide and GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, resulting in large-amplitude, slow EEG oscillations. Local, activity-dependent factors modulate the amplitude and frequency of cortical slow oscillations. Non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep results in conservation of brain energy and facilitates memory consolidation through the modulation of synaptic weights. Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep results from the interaction of brain stem cholinergic, aminergic, and GABAergic neurons which control the activity of glutamatergic reticular formation neurons leading to REM sleep phenomena such as muscle atonia, REMs, dreaming, and cortical activation. Strong activation of limbic regions during REM sleep suggests a role in regulation of emotion. Genetic studies suggest that brain mechanisms controlling waking and NREM sleep are strongly conserved throughout evolution, underscoring their enormous importance for brain function. Sleep disruption interferes with the normal restorative functions of NREM and REM sleep, resulting in disruptions of breathing and cardiovascular function, changes in emotional reactivity, and cognitive impairments in attention, memory, and decision making.},

  abstract = {Eusociality in mammals is defined in the present paper by the following criteria: reproductive altruism (which involves reproductive division of labor and cooperative alloparental brood care), overlap of adult generations, and permanent (lifelong) philopatry. We argue that additional criteria such as the existence of castes, colony size, reproductive skew, and social cohesion are not pertinent to the definition of eusociality in mammals. According to our definition of mammalian eusociality, several rodent species of the African family Bathyergidae can be considered eusocial, including the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber), Damaraland mole-rat (Cryptomys damarensis), and several additional, if not all, species in the genus Cryptomys. Furthermore, some species of social voles (like Microtus ochrogaster) may also fulfill criteria of mammalian eusociality. Understanding the evolution of eusociality in mole-rats requires answers to two primary questions: (1) What are the preconditions for the development of their eusocial systems? (2) Why do offspring remain in the natal group rather than dispersing and reproducing? Eusociality in mammals is by definition a special case of monogamy (more specifically: monogyny one female breeding), involving prolonged pair bonding for more than one breeding period. We argue that eusociality in mole-rats evolved from a monogamous mating system where cooperative brood care was already established. A tendency for group living is considered to be an ancestral (plesiomorph) trait among African bathyergid mole-rats, linking them to other hystricognath rodents. A solitary lifestyle seen in some genera, such as Bathyergus, Georychus, and Heliophobius, is assumed to be a derived trait that arose independently in different lineages of bathyergids, possibly as a consequence of selective constraints associated with the subterranean environment. In proximate terms, in eusocial mole-rats either puberty is assumed to be developmentally delayed so that under natural conditions most animals die before dispersal is triggered (e.g., in the case of Heterocephalus) or dispersal is induced only by an incidental encounter with an unfamiliar, yet adequate sexual partner (e.g., in the case of Cryptomys). Ultimately, a combination of strategies involving either dispersal and/or philopatry can be beneficial, especially in a highly unpredictable environment. If genetic relatedness among siblings is high (e.g., a coefficient of relatedness of 0.5 or more), then philopatry would not invoke an appreciable loss of fitness, especially if the cost of dispersing is higher than staying within the natal group. High genetic relatedness is more likely in a monogamous mating system or a highly inbred population. In this paper, we argue that the preconditions for eusociality in bathyergid mole-rats were a monogamous mating system and high genetic relatedness among individuals. We argue against the aridity food-distribution hypothesis (AFDH) that suggests a causal relationship between cooperative foraging for patchily distributed resources and the origin of eusociality. The AFDH may explain group size dynamics of social mole-rats as a function of the distribution and availability of resources but it is inadequate to explain the formation of eusocial societies of mole-rats, especially with respect to providing preconditions conducive for the emergence of eusociality.},

Understanding how inhibitory interneurons contribute to brain energy consumption (brain work) is not only of interest in understanding a fundamental aspect of brain function but also in understanding functional brain imaging techniques which rely on measurements related to blood flow and metabolism.

  abstract = {Gamma rhythms are commonly observed in many brain regions during both waking and sleep states, yet their functions and mechanisms remain a matter of debate. Here we review the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying gamma oscillations and outline empirical questions and controversial conceptual issues. Our main points are as follows: First, gamma-band rhythmogenesis is inextricably tied to perisomatic inhibition. Second, gamma oscillations are short-lived and typically emerge from the coordinated interaction of excitation and inhibition, which can be detected as local field potentials. Third, gamma rhythm typically concurs with irregular firing of single neurons, and the network frequency of gamma oscillations varies extensively depending on the underlying mechanism. To document gamma oscillations, efforts should be made to distinguish them from mere increases of gamma-band power and/or increased spiking activity. Fourth, the magnitude of gamma oscillation is modulated by slower rhythms. Such cross-frequency coupling may serve to couple active patches of cortical circuits. Because of their ubiquitous nature and strong correlation with the ``operational modes'' of local circuits, gamma oscillations continue to provide important clues about neuronal population dynamics in health and disease.},

Using in utero electroporation, we eliminated the excitatory action of GABA in a subpopulation of rat ventricular progenitors and cortical neurons derived from these progenitors by premature expression of the Cl- transporter KCC2, as confirmed by the changes in the reversal potential of GABA-induced currents and the resting membrane potential after GABAA receptor blockade. We found that radial migration to layer II/III of the somatosensory cortex of neurons derived from the transfected progenitors was not significantly affected, but their morphological maturation was markedly impaired. Furthermore, reducing neuronal excitability of cortical neurons in vivo by overexpressing an inward-rectifying K+ channel, which lowered the resting membrane potential, mimicked the effect of premature KCC2 expression. Thus, membrane depolarization caused by early GABA excitation is critical for morphological maturation of neonatal cortical neurons in vivo.},

We previously showed that GABAergic short-term plasticity is impaired in App knock-out (App-/-) animals, but the precise mechanism by which APP regulates GABAergic synaptic transmission has remained elusive. Using electrophysiological, biochemical, moleculobiological, and pharmacological analysis, here we show that APP can physically interact with KCC2, a neuron-specific K+-Cl- cotransporter that is essential for Cl- homeostasis and fast GABAergic inhibition. APP deficiency results in significant reductions in both total and membrane KCC2 levels, leading to a depolarizing shift in the GABA reversal potential (EGABA). Simultaneous measurement of presynaptic action potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in hippocampal neurons reveals impaired unitary IPSC amplitudes attributable to a reduction in {$\alpha$}1 subunit levels of GABAAR. Importantly, restoration of normal KCC2 expression and function in App-/- mice rescues EGABA, GABAAR {$\alpha$}1 levels and GABAAR mediated phasic inhibition. We show that APP functions to limit tyrosine-phosphorylation and ubiquitination and thus subsequent degradation of KCC2, providing a mechanism by which APP influences KCC2 abundance. Together, these experiments elucidate a novel molecular pathway in which APP regulates, via protein-protein interaction with KCC2, GABAAR mediated inhibition in the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {Many human spinal cord injuries are anatomically incomplete but exhibit complete paralysis. It is unknown why spared axons fail to mediate functional recovery in these cases. To investigate this, we undertook a small-molecule screen in mice with staggered bilateral hemisections in which the lumbar spinal cord is deprived of all direct brain-derived innervation, but dormant relay circuits remain. We discovered that a KCC2 agonist restored stepping ability, which could be mimicked by selective expression of KCC2, or hyperpolarizing DREADDs, in the inhibitory interneurons between and around the staggered spinal lesions. Mechanistically, these treatments transformed this injury-induced dysfunctional spinal circuit to a functional state, facilitating the relay of brain-derived commands toward the lumbar spinal cord. Thus, our results identify spinal inhibitory interneurons as a roadblock limiting the integration of descending inputs into relay circuits after injury and suggest KCC2 agonists as promising treatments for promoting functional recovery after spinal cord injury.},

Recent drug discovery efforts have developed GABAA{$\alpha$}2,3-subunit-selective partial modulators in an effort to dissociate the side effect liabilities from the efficacy imparted by benzodiazepines. Here, we evaluated rat EEG and behavioral end points during dosing of nine chemically distinct compounds that we confirmed statistically to selectively to enhance GABAA{$\alpha$}2,3-mediated vs. GABAA{$\alpha$}1 or GABAA{$\alpha$}5 currents in voltage clamped oocytes transfected with those GABAA subunits. These compounds were shown with in vivo receptor occupancy techniques to competitively displace [3H]flumazenil in multiple brain regions following peripheral administration at increasing doses. Over the same dose range, the compounds all produced dose-dependent EEG spectral power increases in the {$\beta$}- and and {$\gamma$}-bands. Finally, the dose range that increased {$\gamma$}-power coincided with that eliciting punished over unpunished responding in a behavioral conflict model of anxiety, indicative of anxiolysis without sedation. EEG {$\gamma$}-band power increases showed a significant positive correlation to in vitro GABAA{$\alpha$}2,3 modulatory intrinsic activity across the compound set, further supporting a hypothesis that this EEG signature was linked specifically to pharmacological modulation of GABAA{$\alpha$}2,3 signaling. These findings encourage further evaluation of this EEG signature as a noninvasive clinical translational biomarker that could ultimately facilitate development of GABAA{$\alpha$}2,3-subtype-selective drugs for anxiety and potentially other indications.},

The physiological mechanisms underlying this tolerance, however, are poorly understood. Most vertebrates hyperventilate in acute hypoxia and exhibit an enhanced hyperventilation following acclimatization to chronic sustained hypoxia (CSH). Conversely, naked mole rats do not hyperventilate in acute hypoxia and their response to CSH has not been examined. In this study, we explored mechanisms of plasticity in the control of the hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) and hypoxic metabolic response (HMR) of freely behaving naked mole rats following 8\textendash 10 days of chronic sustained normoxia (CSN) or CSH. Specifically, we investigated the role of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter {$\gamma$}-amino butyric acid (GABA) in mediating these responses. Our study yielded three important findings. First, naked mole rats did not exhibit ventilatory plasticity following CSH, which is unique among adult animals studied to date. Second, GABA receptor (GABAR) antagonism altered breathing patterns in CSN and CSH animals and modulated the acute HVR in CSN animals. Third, naked mole rats exhibited GABAR-dependent metabolic plasticity following long-term hypoxia, such that the basal metabolic rate was approximately 25\% higher in normoxic CSH animals than CSN animals, and GABAR antagonists modulated this increase.},

Aggression in the form of shoving (prolonged pushes involving nose to nose contact) is frequently observed in captive colonies and is principally initiated by breeders. It has been suggested that shoving by queens functions primarily to suppress reproduction in subordinates (threat reduction hypothesis) or to incite work activity in nonbreeding `helpers' (work conflict hypothesis). We tested predictions of both hypotheses by examining shoving in five captive colonies before and after removing breeders. Shoving was strongly associated with reproductive status. The vast majority of shoves were carried out by the queen, and to a lesser extent breeding males, and the onset of reproductive activity coincided with the onset, or greatly increased rates, of shoving. No evidence for the work conflict hypothesis was found. Queens shoved high-ranking and large colony members most, a finding that does not allow discrimination between hypotheses. Those males that posed the greatest threat to the queen's reproductive dominance, namely future breeding males, were shoved most, providing some support for the threat reduction hypothesis. However, evidence that queens targeted those females that posed the greatest threat, females that were to succeed them, was equivocal. Queen shoving may have several functions, depending on social context, in inhibiting reproduction in subordinates of both sexes, maintaining social order, and in inciting work-related behaviours in colony members, all of which ultimately increase the reproductive success of queens.},

  abstract = {Naked mole-rats (NMRs) live in large colonies within densely populated underground burrows. Their collective respiration generates significant metabolic carbon dioxide (CO2) that diffuses slowly out of the burrow network, creating a hypercapnic environment. Currently, the physiological mechanisms that underlie the ability of NMRs to tolerate environmental hypercapnia are largely unknown. To address this, we used whole-body plethysmography and respirometry to elucidate the hypercapnic ventilatory and metabolic responses of awake, freely behaving NMRs to 0\%\textendash 10\% CO2. We found that NMRs have a blunted hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR): ventilation increased only in 10\% CO2. Conversely, metabolism was unaffected by hypercapnia. NMRs are insensitive to cutaneous acid-based pain caused by modified substance P (SP)-mediated peripheral neurotransmission, and SP is also an important neuromodulator of ventilation. Therefore, we re-evaluated physiological responses to hypercapnia in NMRs after an intraperitoneal injection of exogenous substance P (2 mg/kg) or a long-lived isoform of substance P \{[pGlu5-MePhe8-MeGly9]SP(5-11), DiMe-C7; 40\textendash 400 {$\mu$}g/kg\}. We found that both drugs restored hypercapnia sensitivity and unmasked an HCVR in animals breathing 2\%\textendash 10\% CO2. Taken together, our findings indicate that NMRs are remarkably tolerant of hypercapnic environments and have a blunted HCVR; however, the signaling network architecture required for a ``normal'' HCVR is retained but endogenously inactive. This muting of chemosensitivity likely suits the ecophysiology of this species, which presumably experiences hypercapnia regularly in their underground niche.},

  abstract = {Seizure activity is governed by changes in normal neuronal physiology that lead to a state of neuronal hyperexcitability and synchrony. There is a growing body of research and evidence suggesting that alterations in the volume fraction ({$\alpha$}) of the brain's extracellular space (ECS) have the ability to prolong or even initiate seizures. These ictogenic effects likely occur due to the ECS volume being critically important in determining both the concentration of neuroactive substances contained within it, such as ions and neurotransmitters, and the effect of electric field-mediated interactions between neurons. Changes in the size of the ECS likely both precede a seizure, assisting in its initiation, and occur during a seizure, assisting in its maintenance. Different cellular ion and water transporters and channels are essential mediators in determining neuronal excitability and synchrony and can do so through alterations in ECS volume and/or through non-ECS volume related mechanisms. This review will parse out the relationships between how the ECS volume changes during normal physiology and seizures, how those changes might alter neuronal physiology to promote seizures, and what ion and water transporters and channels are important in linking ECS volume changes and seizures.},

  abstract = {During a two year period prospective continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring of 275 infants identified seizure activity in 55 cases, 31 of whom were treated with anticonvulsant drugs on clinical grounds. EEG and clinical response was complete in only two and equivocal in another six. Clinical response with persistent EEG seizures occurred in 13 and neither clinical nor EEG response in 10. There was no significant improvement in the generally poor neurological outcome compared with that in 24 infants whose seizures were not treated because of limited or absent clinical manifestations. Background EEG abnormality (as an index of associated cerebral dysfunction) was a guide to potential lack of response to anticonvulsant drugs; it was also predictive of subsequent clinical outcome irrespective of treatment. This study shows that commonly used anticonvulsant drugs (phenobarbitone, paraldehyde, phenytoin, and diazepam) have little effect on seizure control or neurological outcome in neonatal seizures associated with haemorrhagic, hypoxic, or ischaemic cerebral lesions. In view of the variable clinical appearance of EEG seizure activity, continuous EEG monitoring should be an essential feature of further study of neonatal anticonvulsant treatment.},

  abstract = {The family of mammalian bicarbonate transport proteins are involved in a wide-range of physiological processes. The importance of bicarbonate transport follows from the biochemistry of HCO3- itself. Bicarbonate is the waste product of mitochondrial respiration. HCO3- undergoes pH-dependent conversion into CO2 and in doing so converts from a membrane impermeant anion into a gas that can diffuse across membranes. The CO2\textendash HCO3- equilibrium forms the most important pH buffering system of our bodies. Bicarbonate transport proteins facilitate the movement of membrane-impermeant HCO3- across membranes to accelerate disposal of waste CO2, control cellular and whole-body pH, and to regulate fluid movement and acid/base secretion. Defects of bicarbonate transport proteins manifest in diseases of most organ systems. Fourteen gene products facilitate mammalian bicarbonate transport, whose physiology and pathophysiology is discussed in the present review.},

  abstract = {Hyaluronan is a simple repeating disaccharide polymer, synthesized at the cell surface by integral membrane synthases. The repeating sequence is perfectly homogeneous, and is the same in all vertebrate tissues and fluids. The polymer molecular mass is more variable. Most commonly, hyaluronan is synthesized as a high molecular mass polymer, with an average molecular mass of approximately 1000-8000 kDa. There are a number of studies showing increased hyaluronan content, but reduced average molecular mass with a broader range of sizes present, in tissues or fluids when inflammatory or tissue remodeling processes occur. In parallel studies, exogenous hyaluronan fragments of low molecular mass (generally, less than about 200 kDa) have been shown to affect cell behavior through binding to receptor proteins such as CD44 and RHAMM (gene name HMMR), and to signal either directly or indirectly through Toll-like receptors. These data suggest that receptor sensitivity to hyaluronan size provides a biosensor of the state of the microenvironment surrounding the cell. Sensitive methods for isolation and characterization of hyaluronan and its fragments have been developed and continue to improve. This review provides an overview of the methods and our current state of knowledge of hyaluronan content and size distribution in biological fluids and tissues.},

  abstract = {The article discusses advances in osmoregulation and excretion with emphasis on how multicellu-lar animals in different osmotic environments regulate their milieu int\'erieur. Mechanisms of energy transformations in animal osmoregulation are dealt with in biophysical terms with respect to wa-ter and ion exchange across biological membranes and coupling of ion and water fluxes across epithelia. The discussion of functions is based on a comparative approach analyzing mechanisms that have evolved in different taxonomic groups at biochemical, cellular and tissue levels and their integration in maintaining whole body water and ion homeostasis. The focus is on recent studies of adaptations and newly discovered mechanisms of acclimatization during transitions of animals between different osmotic environments. Special attention is paid to hypotheses about the diversity of cellular organization of osmoregulatory and excretory organs such as glomerular kidneys, antennal glands, Malpighian tubules and insect gut, gills, integument and intestine, with accounts on experimental approaches and methods applied in the studies. It is demonstrated how knowledge in these areas of comparative physiology has expanded considerably during the last two decades, bridging seminal classical works with studies based on new approaches at all levels of anatomical and functional organization. A number of as yet partially unanswered questions are emphasized, some of which are about how water and solute exchange mechanisms at lower levels are integrated for regulating whole body extracellular water volume and ion homeostasis of animals in their natural habitats.

Fasting also stimulates foraging and food hoarding (appetitive ingestive behaviors) by Siberian hamsters but does relatively little to change food intake (consummatory ingestive behavior). Therefore, we tested the effects of third ventricular NPY Y1 ([Pro34]NPY) or Y5 ([d-Trp34]NPY) receptor agonists on these ingestive behaviors using a wheel running-based food delivery system coupled with simulated burrow housing. Siberian hamsters had 1) no running wheel access and free food, 2) running wheel access and free food, or 3) foraging requirements (10 or 50 revolutions/pellet). NPY (1.76 nmol) stimulated food intake only during the first 4 h postinjection ({$\sim$}200\textendash 1,000\%) and mostly in hamsters with a foraging requirement. The Y1 receptor agonist markedly increased food hoarding (250\textendash 1,000\%), increased foraging as well as wheel running per se, and had relatively little effect on food intake ({$<$}250\%). Unlike NPY, the Y5 agonist significantly increased food intake, especially in foraging animals ({$\sim$}225\textendash 800\%), marginally increased food hoarding (250\textendash 500\%), and stimulated foraging and wheel running 4\textendash 24 h postinjection, with the distribution of earned pellets favoring eating versus hoarding across time. Across treatments, food hoarding predominated early postinjection, whereas food intake tended to do so later. Collectively, NPY stimulated both appetitive and consummatory ingestive behaviors in Siberian hamsters involving Y1/Y5 receptors, with food hoarding and foraging/wheel running (appetitive) more involved with Y1 receptors and food intake (consummatory) with Y5 receptors.},

  abstract = {Naked mole-rats (NMR) live underground in large eusocial colonies in East Africa. They are extremely long-lived, some individuals having a lifespan of over 30 years. This has attracted research into longevity and possibly neurodegenerative disorders. However, very little is known about their basic behaviour, particularly in tests commonly used to characterise the behaviour of the laboratory rat and mouse, for which there is an enormous database. Recently the authors carried out comprehensive behavioural phenotyping on NMRs, comparing them on most tasks directly with C57BL/6 mice, the strain for which there is the largest behavioural database. The NMR colony had been obtained from the wild originally, but housed in an animal facility for about two years. Large inter-species differences in behaviour were seen between the mice and the NMRs. The latter had generally poor sensorimotor function, including cutaneous sensation, strength and even grasp reflexes. They were often reluctant to enter or head-dip into small holes that mice readily entered. Their vision (generally considered to be very poor) was sufficient to distinguish the two zones of a light\textendash dark box. Although, as expected, the NMRs were capable of burrowing and digging, when individually housed they did not shred cotton material to make nests. Shredding was seen in a colony cage containing a queen, but no nests were made there even when a nesting box was provided. In cognitive testing, although, unlike mice and rats, they did not spontaneously alternate in a T-maze, they learnt rewarded alternation and a cued position task well. This study demonstrates how behaviour uniquely reflects the natural environment in which these unusual animals have evolved and live, and provides baseline data for future work.},

  abstract = {The K(+) -Cl(-) cotransporter type 2 is the major Cl(-) extrusion mechanism in most adult neurons. This process in turn leads to Cl(-) influx upon activation of {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA ) receptors and the canonical hyperpolarising inhibitory postsynaptic potential. Several neurological disorders are treated with drugs that target and enhance GABAA receptor signaling, including the commonly used benzodiazepine diazepam and the anesthetic propofol. Some of these disorders are also associated with deficits in GABAA signaling and become less sensitive to therapeutic drugs that target GABAA receptors. To date, it is unknown if alterations in the neuronal Cl(-) gradient affect the efficacies of diazepam and propofol. We therefore used the in vitro model of glutamate-induced hyperexcitability to test if alterations in the Cl(-) gradient affect the efficacy of GABAA modulators. We exclusively utilised the gramicidin perforated-patch-clamp configuration to preserve the endogenous Cl(-) gradient in rat neurons. Brief exposure to glutamate reduced the inhibitory efficacy of diazepam within 5 min, which was caused by the collapse of the Cl(-) gradient, and not due to reductions in GABAA receptor number. Unlike diazepam, propofol retained its efficacy by shunting the membrane conductance despite the glutamate-induced appearance of depolarising GABAA -mediated currents. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of K(+) -Cl(-) cotransporter type 2 by furosemide disrupted Cl(-) homeostasis and reduced the efficacy of diazepam but not propofol. Collectively our results suggest that pathological hyperexcitable conditions could cause the rapid accumulation of intracellular Cl(-) and the appearance of depolarising GABAA -mediated currents that would decrease the efficacy of diazepam.},

In rodents and humans, this vital process is mediated in part via the direct sensing of CO2 via connexin26 (Cx26). CO2 binds to hemichannels of Cx26 causing them to open and allow release of the neurotransmitter ATP. If Cx26 were to be a universal and important CO2 sensor across all homeothermic animals, then a simple hypothesis would posit that it should exhibit evolutionary adaptation in animals with different homeostatic set points for the regulation of partial pressure of arterial CO2 (PaCO2). In humans and rats, PaCO2 is regulated around a set point of 40 mmHg. By contrast, birds are able to maintain cerebral blood flow and breathing at much lower levels of PaCO2 Fossorial mammals, such as the mole rat, live exclusively underground in burrows that are both hypoxic and hypercapnic and can thrive under very hypercapnic conditions. We have therefore compared the CO2 sensitivity of Cx26 from human, chicken, rat and mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber). We find that both the affinity and cooperativity of CO2 binding to Cx26 have been subjected to evolutionary adaption in a manner consistent with the homeostatic requirements of these four species. This is analogous to the evolutionary adaptation of haemoglobin to the needs of O2 transport across the animal kingdom and supports the hypothesis that Cx26 is an important and universal CO2 sensor in homeotherms.},

  abstract = {Author Summary Fast synaptic inhibition relies on chloride current to hyperpolarize the neuron or to prevent depolarization caused by concurrent excitatory input. Both scenarios necessarily involve chloride flux into the cell and, thus, a change in intracellular chloride concentration. The vast majority of models neglect changes in ion concentration despite experimental evidence that such changes occur and are not inconsequential. The importance of considering chloride homeostasis mechanisms is heightened by evidence that several neurological diseases are associated with deficient chloride extrusion capacity. Steady state chloride levels are altered in those disease states. Fast chloride dynamics are also likely affected, but those changes have yet to be explored. To this end, we built an electrodiffusion model that tracks changes in the concentration of chloride plus multiple other ion species. Simulations in this model revealed a multitude of complex, nonlinear interactions that have important consequences for the efficacy of synaptic inhibition. Several predictions from the model were tested and confirmed with chloride imaging experiments.},

Febrile seizures were more common in boys (3.9\%; 95\% CI, 3.9\%-4.0\%) than in girls (3.3\%; 95\% CI, 3.2\%-3.3\%), corresponding to a 21\% relative risk difference (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95\% CI, 1.19-1.22). However, the risks of recurrent febrile seizures, epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, and death were similar in boys and girls. The risk of (recurrent) febrile seizures increased with the number of febrile seizures: 3.6\% at birth, 22.7\% (95\% CI, 22.4\%-23.0\%) after the first febrile seizure, 35.6\% (95\% CI, (34.9\%-36.3\%) after the second febrile seizure, and 43.5\% (95\% CI, (42.3\%-44.7\%) after the third febrile seizure. The risk of epilepsy increased progressively with the number of hospital admissions with febrile seizures.

  abstract = {In addition to affecting respiration and vascular tone, deviations from normal CO2 alter pH, consciousness, and seizure propensity. Outside the brainstem, however, the mechanisms by which CO2 levels modify neuronal function are unknown. In the hippocampal slice preparation, increasing CO2, and thus decreasing pH, increased the extracellular concentration of the endogenous neuromodulator adenosine and inhibited excitatory synaptic transmission. These effects involve adenosine A1 and ATP receptors and depend on decreased extracellular pH. In contrast, decreasing CO2 levels reduced extracellular adenosine concentration and increased neuronal excitability via adenosine A1 receptors, ATP receptors, and ecto-ATPase. Based on these studies, we propose that CO2-induced changes in neuronal function arise from a pH-dependent modulation of adenosine and ATP levels. These findings demonstrate a mechanism for the bidirectional effects of CO2 on neuronal excitability in the forebrain.},

  abstract = {In many social species, hierarchical status within the group is associated with differences in basal adrenocortical activity. We examined this relationship in naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber), eusocial rodents with arguably the most extreme social hierarchies of all mammals. This species lives in colonies where breeding is restricted to one socially dominant `queen' and her male consorts, and all other individuals are reproductively suppressed `subordinates'. The relationship between cortisol and social status in naked mole-rats has not fully been elucidated, as prior results on this topic have been contradictory. We used non-invasive feces sampling to measure baseline cortisol levels in eight laboratory colonies of naked mole-rats, to either replicate or reject rank differences. First, we successfully validated an assay to measure fecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs). Removal from the colony for the validation experiment, either alone or with an opposite sex conspecific, induced prolonged elevation of FCM levels on a scale of days to weeks. This increase in cortisol did not prevent the removed animals from sexually maturing. In colony-housed animals, we found no relationship between rank in the social hierarchy and FCM levels. Further, queens, breeding males, and reproductively suppressed subordinates all had equivalent FCM levels. We conclude that this species shows little evidence of the `stress of dominance' or `stress of subordination' and that reproductive suppression in naked mole-rats is not driven by elevated cortisol levels.},

The protein abundance and activity of CAII in erythrocytes was significantly higher in CO2-exposed embryos compared to normal conditions. Daily injections of acetazolamide (ATZ), an inhibitor of CA, increased blood PCO2 and decreased blood pH in both control and CO2-incubated embryos. ATZ increased blood bicarbonate concentration in embryos exposed to normal atmosphere and in day-12 embryos exposed to high CO2. The tendency of an increased blood potassium concentration in ATZ-injected embryos under standard atmospheric conditions might indicate that protons were exchanged with intracellular potassium. However, there was no evidence for such an exchange in CO2-incubated ATZ-treated embryos. This study shows for the first time that chicken embryos adapt to CO2 during the second half of incubation by increasing CAII protein expression and function in red blood cells. This response may serve to ``buffer'' elevated CO2 levels.},

Comparative genome analyses, along with the transcriptomes of related subterranean rodents, revealed candidate molecular adaptations for subterranean life and longevity, including a divergent insulin peptide, expression of oxygen-carrying globins in the brain, prevention of high CO2-induced pain perception, and enhanced ammonia detoxification. Juxtaposition of the genomes of DMR and other more conventional animals with the genome of NMR revealed several truly exceptional NMR features: unusual thermogenesis, an aberrant melatonin system, pain insensitivity, and unique processing of 28S rRNA. Together, these genomes and transcriptomes extend our understanding of subterranean adaptations, stress resistance, and longevity.},

The receptors themselves are diverse, being formed from a variety of subunits, each with a different temporal and spatial pattern of expression. This diversity is reflected in differences in subcellular targetting and in the subtleties of their response to GABA. While activation of the receptors leads to an inevitable increase in membrane conductance, the voltage response is dictated by the distribution of the permeant Cl- and HCO3- ions, which is established by anion transporters. Similar to GABAA receptors, the expression of these transporters is not only developmentally regulated but shows cell-specific and subcellular variation. Untangling all these complexities allows us to appreciate the variety of GABA-mediated signalling, a diverse set of phenomena encompassing both synaptic and non-synaptic functions that can be overtly excitatory as well as inhibitory.},

Current--voltage relations for both agonists displayed rectification with single-channel conductance increasing at positive potentials. Permeabilities determined from reversal potentials were maximal for anions with a diameter of about 4 angstrom. Larger diameter anions had lower permeabilities, consistent with an approximate pore diameter of 6 angstrom for both agonist-activated channels. The permeability for anions of similar size was greatest for those ions with a more symmetrical charge distribution (e.g. NO\$\_\{3\}\{\}\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} Bicarbonate\$\^\{-\}\$). The permeability sequence was SCN\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} NO\$\_\{3\}\{\}\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} I\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} Br\$\^\{-\}\${$>$} Cl\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} Formate\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} Acetate\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} Bicarbonate\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} Gluconate\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} F\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} Phosphate\$\^\{-\}\$, whereas the conductance sequence for anion efflux was Cl\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} Br\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} NO\$\_\{3\}\{\}\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} I\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} SCN\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} Formate\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} Acetate\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} Bicarbonate\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} Gluconate\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} F\$\^\{-\}\$ {$>$} Phosphate\$\^\{-\}\$. These results suggest that the ions interact with sites within the channel, with hydration forces contributing an important component to the barrier for ion entry into the channel. The spherically symmetrical halides displayed an exponential relation between relative permeability and hydration energy. Concentration dependence of conductance for Cl\$\^\{-\}\$ channels in symmetrical Cl\$\^\{-\}\$ solutions with agonist in the pipette showed an increase at positive potentials and a decrease at negative potentials. GABA- and glycine-activated channels also exhibited anomalous mole-fraction effects in a mixture of Cl\$\^\{-\}\$ and SCN\$\^\{-\}\$.

  abstract = {Previously, we have shown that peripheral challenge of mice with double stranded RNA (dsRNA), a viral mimic, evokes global upregulation of cerebral inflammatory genes and, particularly, genes encoding chemokines. Because chemokine networks are potent modulators of brain function, the present study was undertaken to comprehensively characterize the cerebral response of chemokine ligand and receptor genes to peripheral immune system stimulation. Briefly, C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with 12 mg/kg of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PIC) and the expression of 39 mouse chemokine ligand and 20 receptor genes was monitored in the cerebellum by real time quantitative RT-PCR within 24 h. Almost half of the ligand genes featured either transient or sustained upregulation from several- to several thousand-fold. Five CXC type genes, i.e., Cxcl9, Cxcl11, Cxcl10, Cxcl2 and Cxcl1, were the most robustly upregulated, and were followed by six CC type genes, i.e., Ccl2, Ccl7, Ccl5, Ccl12, Ccl4 and Ccl11. Seven genes showed moderate upregulation, whereas the remaining genes were unresponsive. Six receptor genes, i.e., Cxcr2, Ccr7, Cxcr5, Ccr6, Ccr1 and Ccr5, featured a several-fold upregulation. Similar chemokine gene response was observed in the forebrain and brainstem. This upregulation of chemokine genes could be induced in na\"ive mice by transfer of blood plasma from PIC-challenged mice. Employing oligodeoxynucleotide-labeled PIC we further showed that intraperitoneally injected PIC was not transferred to the blood. In conclusion, peripheral PIC challenge elicits a broad upregulation of cerebral chemokine genes, and this upregulation is mediated by blood-borne agents.},

One pup in each litter was allocated to each of the following treatment groups: vehicle control; caffeine (15 or 30 mg/kg); diazepam (10 mg/kg, alone or plus caffeine 15 or 30 mg/kg). Pups were given daily injections on neonatal days 1\textendash 7 and were observed for 15 min following each injection. Diazepam significantly increased paddling and forward walking, particularly on days 5 and 7; caffeine also increased these behaviors, but less markedly. Diazepam increased the incidence of clonic jerks, particularly on day 7 and increased the spontaneous loss of righting reflex. The pups were then left undisturbed until weaning at day 21 and testing from days 35\textendash 42. There were no lasting effects of the neonatal treatments in two tests of anxiety, or in passive avoidance performance. Rats that had been treated neonatally with diazepam had significantly lower motor activity scores and reared less in the holeboard than did controls, and neonatal treatment with caffeine also resulted in lower motor activity scores. Neonatal treatment with caffeine made rats more aggressive (increased kicking and pushing) when they were intruding into another rat's territory. Neonatal treatment with diazepam increased aggression in resident rats, and this was counteracted by neonatal treatment with caffeine. Neonatal caffeine treatment enhanced rats' unconditioned preference for the black chamber in a black-white preference test and neonatal diazepam treatment reduced it.},

  abstract = {Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) is a synthetic double-stranded RNA that is used experimentally to model viral infections in vivo. Previous studies investigating the inflammatory properties of this agent in rodents demonstrated that it is a potent pyrogen. However, the mechanisms underlying this response have not been fully elucidated. In the current study, we examined the effects of peripheral administration of poly I:C on body temperature and cytokine production. Male rats were implanted with biotelemetry devices and randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: poly I:C + saline, poly I:C + interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), or saline + saline. Maximal fever of 1.6 degrees C above baseline was observed 3 h after an intraperitoneal injection of poly I:C (750 microg/kg). Pretreatment with IL-1ra diminished this response by {$>$}50\% (maximum body temperature = 0.6 degrees C above baseline). Plasma IL-6 concentration increased fivefold 2 h post-poly I:C compared with saline-injected rats; levels returned to baseline 4 h postinjection. Pretreatment with IL-1ra prevented this rise in IL-6. Plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was also increased more than fourfold 2 h postinjection but remained unaffected by IL-1ra treatment. IL-1beta and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA were significantly upregulated in the hypothalamus of poly I:C-treated animals. Finally, poly I:C decreased food intake by 30\%, but this response was not altered by pretreatment with IL-1ra. These results suggest that poly I:C induces fever, but not anorexia, through an IL-1 and prostaglandin-dependent mechanism.},

The response was dose-dependent over the concentration range 0.2\textendash 10 mg/ml, independent of external Ca2+, but abolished by injection of EGTA, a Ca2+ chelator. In addition, hyaluronan sensitivity in oocytes was seasonal with 91\% of the responses occurring between June and December. Pre-heating hyaluronan to {$>$}50\textdegree C reduced the response; at 70\textendash 85\textdegree C the response was lost. Cooling the heated hyaluronan, however, restored the activity. Hyaluronan which had been previously digested with 10 mg/ml hyaluronidase for 1\textendash 7 h (at 37\textdegree C) activated smaller currents: for digestions {$>$}7 h the current-activating ability of hyaluronan was abolished.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanism of K-Cl cotransport (KCC) consists of at least 4 isoforms, KCC 1, 2, 3, and 4 which, in multiple combinations, exist in most cells, including erythrocytes and neuronal cells.
METHODS: We utilized reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and ion flux studies to characterize KCC activity in an immortalized in vitro cell model for fibrous astrocytes, the rat C6 glioblastoma cell. Isoform-specific sets of oligonucleotide primers were synthesized for NKCC1, KCC1, KCC2, KCC3, KCC4, and also for NKCC1 and actin. K-Cl cotransport activity was determined by measuring either the furosemide-sensitive, or the Cl(-)-dependent bumetanide-insensitive Rb(+) (a K(+) congener) influx in the presence of the Na/K pump inhibitor ouabain. Rb(+) influx was measured at a fixed external Cl concentrations, [Cl(-)](e), as a function of varying external Rb concentrations, [Rb(+)](e), and at a fixed [Rb(+)](e) as a function of varying [Cl(-)](e), and with equimolar Cl replacement by anions of the chaotropic series.
RESULTS: RT-PCR of C6 glioblastoma (C6) cells identified mRNA for three KCC isoforms (1, 3, and 4). NKCC1 mRNA was also detected. The apparent K(m) for KCC-mediated Rb(+) influx was 15 mM [Rb(+)](e), and V(max) 12.5 nmol Rb(+) * mg protein(-1) * minute(-1). The calculated apparent K(m) for external Cl(-) was 13 mM and V(max) 14.4 nmol Rb(+) * mg protein(-1) * minute(-1). The anion selectivity sequence of the furosemide-sensitive Rb(+) influx was Cl(-){$>$}Br-=NO(3)(-){$>$}I(-)=SCN(-){$>$}Sfm(-) (sulfamate). Established activators of K-Cl cotransport, hyposmotic shock and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) pretreatment, stimulated furosemide-sensitive Rb(+) influx. A \~n50\% NEM-induced loss of intracellular K(+) was prevented by furosemide.
CONCLUSION: We have identified by RT-PCR the presence of three distinct KCC isoforms (1, 3, and 4) in rat C6 glioblastoma cells, and functionally characterized the anion selectivity and kinetics of their collective sodium-independent cation-chloride cotransport activity.},

  abstract = {Summary
Electroclinical uncoupling of neonatal seizures refers~to electrographic seizure activity that is not clinically manifest. Uncoupling increases after treatment with Phenobarbital, which enhances the GABAA receptor (GABAAR) conductance. The effects of GABAAR activation depend on the intracellular Cl- concentration ([Cl-]i) that is determined by the inward Cl- transporter NKCC1 and the outward Cl- transporter KCC2. Differential maturation of Cl- transport observed in cortical versus subcortical regions should alter the efficacy of GABA-mediated inhibition. In perinatal rat pups, most thalamic neurons maintained low [Cl-]i and were inhibited by GABA. Phenobarbital suppressed thalamic seizure activity. Most neocortical neurons maintained higher [Cl-]i, and were excited by GABAAR activation. Phenobarbital had insignificant anticonvulsant responses in the neocortex until NKCC1 was blocked. Regional differences in the ontogeny of Cl- transport may thus explain why seizure activity in the cortex is not~suppressed by anticonvulsants that block the transmission of seizure activity through subcortical networks.},

  abstract = {Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) are fossorial, eusocial mammals that live in colonies averaging about 70 individuals. Metabolic regulation is of particular interest in this species because it is one of only two naturally occurring small mammals that are hairless. Further, relative to other small mammals, naked mole-rats exhibit low body temperature (Tb) and weak capacity to maintain Tb above the ambient temperature (Ta). The present study examined effects of Ta, norepinephrine (NE), and chronic food restriction on O2 consumption (as a measure of metabolism) in naked mole-rats. Studies were performed in both awake and anesthetized animals. Metabolic rate decreased with increasing T. over the range of 23-34 degrees C in awake mole-rats, whereas in anesthetized animals rates of O2 consumption were very low over this entire range of Ta and tended to increase with increasing Ta. Injections of NE led to rapid increases in metabolic rate at all Tas in anesthetized subjects and also at Ta = 34 degrees C in awake mole-rats. However, at Tas of 29 and 23 degrees C, awake subjects given NE showed little stimulation of O2 consumption beyond the already elevated baseline rates observed at these Tas. During chronic restriction of food to 60-70\% of their normal daily consumption mole-rats exhibited decreased rates of metabolism; metabolic rate was not altered following several hours of acute food deprivation. Food consumption remained somewhat decreased after a period of chronic food restriction, even when animals were returned to ad lib conditions. However, body weights returned to prerestriction values, despite the continued reduction in ad lib food intake. These observations suggest that mole-rats may be capable of long-lasting metabolic adaptations as a means to cope with restricted food supply. These findings are discussed in relation to adaptation of this fossorial species to a habitat where food has a patchy distribution. Naked mole-rats, with their several unusual thermoregulatory and behavioral features, provide an intriguing model for studies of mammalian metabolic regulation.},

  abstract = {During early development, {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) depolarizes and excites neurons, contrary to its typical function in the mature nervous system. As a result, developing networks are hyperexcitable and experience a spontaneous network activity that is important for several aspects of development. GABA is depolarizing because chloride is accumulated beyond its passive distribution in these developing cells. Identifying all of the transporters that accumulate chloride in immature neurons has been elusive and it is unknown whether chloride levels are different at synaptic and extrasynaptic locations. We have therefore assessed intracellular chloride levels specifically at synaptic locations in embryonic motoneurons by measuring the GABAergic reversal potential (EGABA) for GABAA miniature postsynaptic currents. When whole cell patch solutions contained 17\textendash 52 mM chloride, we found that synaptic EGABA was around -30 mV. Because of the low HCO3- permeability of the GABAA receptor, this value of EGABA corresponds to approximately 50 mM intracellular chloride. It is likely that synaptic chloride is maintained at levels higher than the patch solution by chloride accumulators. We show that the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter, NKCC1, is clearly involved in the accumulation of chloride in motoneurons because blocking this transporter hyperpolarized EGABA and reduced nerve potentials evoked by local application of a GABAA agonist. However, chloride accumulation following NKCC1 block was still clearly present. We find physiological evidence of chloride accumulation that is dependent on HCO3- and sensitive to an anion exchanger blocker. These results suggest that the anion exchanger, AE3, is also likely to contribute to chloride accumulation in embryonic motoneurons.},

  abstract = {The regulation of intracellular chloride has important roles in neuronal function, especially by setting the magnitude and direction of the Cl- flux gated by GABAA receptors. Previous studies have shown that GABAA-mediated inhibition is less effective in dopaminergic than in GABAergic neurons in substantia nigra. We studied whether this phenomenon may be related to a difference in Cl-regulatory mechanisms. Light-microscopic immunocytochemistry revealed that the potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2) was localized only in the dendrites of nondopaminergic (primarily GABAergic) neurons in the substantia nigra, whereas the voltage-sensitive chloride channel 2 (ClC-2) was observed only in the dopaminergic neurons of the pars compacta. Electron-microscopic immunogold labeling confirmed that KCC2 is localized in the dendritic plasma membrane of GABAergic neurons close to inhibitory synapses. Confocal microscopy showed that ClC-2 was selectively expressed in the somatic and dendritic cell membranes of the dopaminergic neurons. Gramicidin-perforated-patch recordings revealed that the GABAA IPSP reversal potential was significantly less negative and had a much smaller hyperpolarizing driving force in dopaminergic than in GABAergic neurons. The GABAA reversal potential was significantly less negative in bicarbonate-free buffer in dopaminergic but not in GABAergic neurons. The present study suggests that KCC2 is responsible for maintaining the low intracellular Cl- concentration in nigral GABAergic neurons, whereas a sodium-dependent anion (Cl--HCO3-) exchanger and ClC-2 are likely to serve this role in dopaminergic neurons. The relatively low efficacy of GABAA-mediated inhibition in nigral dopaminergic neurons compared with nigral GABAergic neurons may be related to their lack of KCC2.},

The conditions of their underground burrows result in competition for oxygen consumption, yet despite this oxygen deprivation they emerge unscathed. To understand the mechanisms in place to facilitate neuronal preservation during hypoxia, we investigated the protein levels of well-known cell-stress factors. We found that under hypoxic conditions, nearly half of the proteins measured increased expression in brain, while only a few decreased. Under hypoxic conditions there appeared to be a HIF1{$\alpha$}-centered response, where HIF1{$\alpha$} and its interactors carbonic anhydrase 9, CITED2, p21/CIP1, and NF{$\kappa$}B1, among others, were upregulated. Concurrently, a hypoxia-induced decrease of cytochrome c was consistent with decreased mitochondrial function and protection from apoptosis. The picture that emerges is one of neuroprotection, cell-cycle arrest, and the promotion of antiapoptotic functions, all of which are consistent with conserving energy and maintaining neural integrity under low oxygen levels. These results suggest how this species may be poised to face hypoxia and contribute to its remarkable ability to deal with myriad of other damaging factors and sets the stage for future work on the neuroprotective facilitators we identified.},

  abstract = {Birth asphyxia is often associated with a high seizure burden that is predictive of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. The mechanisms underlying birth asphyxia seizures are unknown. Using an animal model of birth asphyxia based on 6-day-old rat pups, we have recently shown that the seizure burden is linked to an increase in brain extracellular pH that consists of the recovery from the asphyxia-induced acidosis, and of a subsequent plateau level well above normal extracellular pH. In the present study, two-photon imaging of intracellular pH in neocortical neurons in vivo showed that pH changes also underwent a biphasic acid-alkaline response, resulting in an alkaline plateau level. The mean alkaline overshoot was strongly suppressed by a graded restoration of normocapnia after asphyxia. The parallel post-asphyxia increase in extra- and intracellular pH levels indicated a net loss of acid equivalents from brain tissue that was not attributable to a disruption of the blood-brain barrier, as demonstrated by a lack of increased sodium fluorescein extravasation into the brain, and by the electrophysiological characteristics of the blood-brain barrier. Indeed, electrode recordings of pH in the brain and trunk demonstrated a net efflux of acid equivalents from the brain across the blood-brain barrier, which was abolished by the Na/H exchange inhibitor, N-methyl-isobutyl amiloride. Pharmacological inhibition of Na/H exchange also suppressed the seizure activity associated with the brain-specific alkalosis. Our findings show that the post-asphyxia seizures are attributable to an enhanced Na/H exchange-dependent net extrusion of acid equivalents across the blood-brain barrier and to consequent brain alkalosis. These results suggest targeting of blood-brain barrier-mediated pH regulation as a novel approach in the prevention and therapy of neonatal seizures.},

Using this method, we demonstrate that the surface levels of GluR1/2 and GluR2/3 complexes are reduced following NMDA-evoked long-term depression (NMDA-LTD) in acute hippocampal slices.

Most of what we know, however, comes from work on relatively non-social species in which direct reproduction (i.e., production of offspring) is virtually the only route to reproductive success. In social species, an individual's inclusive fitness may include contributions to the gene pool that are achieved by supporting the reproductive efforts of close relatives; this feature is most evident in eusocial organisms. Here, we review what is known about neuroendocrine mechanisms, sexual differentiation, and effects of social status on the brain and spinal cord in two eusocial mammals: the naked mole-rat and Damaraland mole-rat. These small rodents exhibit the most rigidly organized reproductive hierarchy among mammals, with reproduction suppressed in a majority of individuals. Our findings suggest that eusociality may be associated with a relative lack of sex differences and a reduced influence of gonadal hormones on some functions to which these hormones are usually tightly linked. We also identify neural changes accompanying a change in social and reproductive status, and discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the evolution of sex differences and the neuroendocrinology of reproductive suppression.},

  abstract = {Tortuosity of the extracellular space describes hindrance posed to the diffusion process by a geometrically complex medium in comparison to an environment free of any obstacles. Calculating tortuosity in biologically relevant geometries is difficult. Yet this parameter has proved very important for many processes in the brain, ranging from ischemia and osmotic stress to delivery of nutrients and drugs. It is also significant for interpretation of the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance data. We use a volume-averaging procedure to obtain a general expression for tortuosity in a complex environment. A simple approximation then leads to tortuosity estimates in a number of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) geometries characterized by narrow pathways between the cellular elements. It also explains the counterintuitive fact of lower diffusion hindrance in a 3D environment. Comparison with Monte Carlo numerical simulations shows that the model gives reasonable tortuosity estimates for a number of regular and randomized 2D and 3D geometries. Importantly, it is shown that addition of dead-end pores increases tortuosity in proportion to the square root of enlarged total extracellular volume fraction. This conclusion is further supported by the previously described tortuosity decrease in ischemic brain slices where dead-end pores were partially occluded by large macromolecules introduced into the extracellular space.},

  abstract = {Molecular transport in brain extracellular space (ECS) is hindered by the structure of the tissue. Diffusion analysis of small extracellular markers quantifies tissue hindrance, expressed as tortuosity lambda = (D/D*)(1/2), where D is the free diffusion coefficient and D* is the effective diffusion coefficient in tissue. In healthy brain, lambda is approximately 1.6, but the nature of this parameter is poorly understood. We report that the stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA1 region in vitro, previously shown to be anisotropic (i.e., different along the x-, y-, and z-axes) in in vivo study, is isotropic like somatosensory neocortex but has a reduced lambda. Diffusion of fluorophore-labeled dextran (f-dex, M(r) 3,000) and tetramethylammonium (TMA(+), M(r) 74) was measured in rat brain slices (400 mum) using integrative optical imaging (IOI) and real-time iontophoresis (RTI), respectively. In the stratum radiatum, diffusion of f-dex was similar along the x-, y-, and z-axes (lambda(x), lambda(y); lambda(z) were 1.55, 1.53, and 1.55), but the tortuosity was significantly lower than in the neocortex, where lambda = 1.81. This finding was confirmed by the RTI method, which measured lambda with TMA(+), a much smaller molecule, and determined volume fraction alpha, the proportion of tissue occupied by the ECS. In stratum radiatum, lambda(x), lambda(y), and lambda(z) were 1.47, 1.44, and 1.46, while in neocortex, lambda was 1.65. The ECS volume fraction was similar (0.24) in both regions. It is proposed that in the hippocampus, low lambda reflects a reduced occurrence of concave extracellular microdomains, referred to as dead spaces, which increase tortuosity by transient trapping of markers. Functionally, a low lambda may permit structural plasticity and facilitate extrasynaptic communication. It may also enhance the spread of neuroactive substances and thus contribute to the sensitivity of the hippocampal CA1 region to ischemia and epilepsy.},

The ECS mediates intercellular communication (Nicholson 1979) and the transport of nutrients and metabolites (Sykov\'a et al. 2000), and it forms a reservoir of ions that establishes the resting potentials of cells and mediate fluxes across the membranes. It also may serve to deliver therapeutic substances to cells (Ulbrich et al. 1997; Saltzman 2001). All these processes are primarily mediated by diffusion. The ECS diffusive properties are thus critical for neurotransmission over short and long distances (the latter being called volume transmission, Fuxe and Agnati 1991; Agnati et al. 2000), neurotrophic effects, general electrical activity, basic cellular homeostasis, and drug delivery. This chapter will introduce the brain ECS, describe techniques and preparations most commonly used to measure diffusion properties together with relevant theory and software for data analysis, review selected findings, demonstrate the utility of mathematical modeling and computer simulations, and outline some future directions for research.},

It remains unclear whether the mammalian olfactory system can detect CO2 at concentrations around the average atmospheric level (0.038\%). We demonstrated the expression of carbonic anhydrase type II (CAII), an enzyme that catabolizes CO2, in a subset of mouse olfactory neurons that express guanylyl cyclase D (GC-D+ neurons) and project axons to necklace glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Exposure to CO2 activated these GC-D+ neurons, and exposure of a mouse to CO2 activated bulbar neurons associated with necklace glomeruli. Behavioral tests revealed CO2 detection thresholds of approximately 0.066\%, and this sensitive CO2 detection required CAII activity. We conclude that mice detect CO2 at near-atmospheric concentrations through the olfactory subsystem of GC-D+ neurons.},

  abstract = {Whereas activation of GABAA receptors by GABA usually results in a hyperpolarizing influx of chloride into the neuron, the reversed chloride driving force in the immature nervous system results in a depolarizing efflux of chloride. This GABAergic depolarization is deemed to be important for the maturation of the neuronal network. The concept of a developmental GABA switch has mainly been derived from in vitro experiments and reliable in vivo evidence is still missing. As GABAA receptors are permeable for both chloride and bicarbonate, the net effect of GABA also critically depends on the distribution of bicarbonate. Whereas chloride can either mediate depolarizing or hyperpolarizing currents, bicarbonate invariably mediates a depolarizing current under physiological conditions. Intracellular bicarbonate is quickly replenished by cytosolic carbonic anhydrases. Intracellular bicarbonate levels also depend on different bicarbonate transporters expressed by neurons. The expression of these proteins is not only developmentally regulated but also differs between cell types and even subcellular regions. In this review we will summarize current knowledge about the role of some of these transporters for brain development and brain function.},

  abstract = {Regulation of brain pH is a critical homeostatic process and changes in brain pH modulate various ion channels and receptors and thus neuronal excitability. Tissue acidosis, resulting from hypoxia or hypercapnia, can activate various proteins and ion channels, among which acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) a family of primarily Na+ permeable ion channels, which alongside classical excitotoxicity causes neuronal death. Naked mole-rats (NMRs, Heterocephalus glaber) are long-lived, fossorial, eusocial rodents that display remarkable behavioral/cellular hypoxia and hypercapnia resistance. In the central nervous system, ASIC subunit expression is similar between mouse and NMR with the exception of much lower expression of ASIC4 throughout the NMR brain. However, ASIC function and neuronal sensitivity to sustained acidosis has not been examined in the NMR brain. Here, we show with whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of cultured NMR and mouse cortical and hippocampal neurons that NMR neurons have smaller voltage-gated Na+ channel currents and more hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials. We further demonstrate that acid-mediated currents in NMR neurons are of smaller magnitude than in mouse, and that all currents in both species are reversibly blocked by the ASIC antagonist benzamil. We further demonstrate that NMR neurons show greater resistance to acid-induced cell death than mouse neurons. In summary, NMR neurons show significant cellular resistance to acidotoxicity compared to mouse neurons, contributing factors likely to be smaller ASIC-mediated currents and reduced NaV activity.},

  abstract = {Naked mole rats (NMRs) are among the most hypoxia-tolerant mammals. Other species respond to hypoxia by either escaping the hypoxic environment or drastically decreasing behavioural activity and body temperature (Tb) to conserve energy. However, NMRs rarely leave their underground burrows, which are putatively hypoxic and thermally stable near the NMRs' preferred Tb. Therefore, we asked whether NMRs are able to employ behavioural and thermoregulatory strategies in response to hypoxia despite their need to remain active and the minimal thermal scope in their burrows. We exposed NMRs to progressively deeper levels of hypoxia (from 21 to 0\% O2) while measuring their behaviour and Tb. Behavioural activity decreased 40\textendash 60\% in hypoxia and Tb decreased slightly in moderate hypoxia (5\textendash 9\%) and then further with deeper hypoxia (3\% O2). However, even at 3\% O2 NMRs remained somewhat active and warm, and continued to explore their environment. Remarkably, NMRs were active for greater than 90 s in acute anoxia and Tb and metabolic rate decreased rapidly. We conclude that NMRs are adapted to remain awake and functional even at the extremes of their hypoxia-tolerance. This adaptation likely reflects variable and challenging levels of environmental hypoxia in the natural habitat of this species.},

  abstract = {The role of genetic relatedness in the evolution of eusociality has been the topic of much debate, especially when contrasting eusocial insects with vertebrates displaying reproductive altruism. The naked mole-rat, Heterocephalus glaber, was the first described eusocial mammal. Although this discovery was based on an ecological constraints model of eusocial evolution, early genetic studies reported high levels of relatedness in naked mole-rats, providing a compelling argument that low dispersal rates and consanguineous mating (inbreeding as a mating system) are the driving forces for the evolution of this eusocial species. One caveat to accepting this long-held view is that the original genetic studies were based on limited sampling from the species' geographic distribution. A growing body of evidence supports a contrary view, with the original samples not representative of the species-rather reflecting a single founder event, establishing a small population south of the Athi River. Our study is the first to address these competing hypotheses by examining patterns of molecular variation in colonies sampled from north and south of the Athi and Tana rivers, which based on our results, serve to isolate genetically distinct populations of naked mole-rats. Although colonies south of the Athi River share a single mtDNA haplotype and are fixed at most microsatellite loci, populations north of the Athi River are considerably more variable. Our findings support the position that the low variation observed in naked mole-rat populations south of the Athi River reflects a founder event, rather than a consequence of this species' unusual mating system.},

  abstract = {Seizures and brain injury lead to water and Cl- accumulation in neurons. The increase in intraneuronal Cl- concentration ([Cl-]i) depolarizes the GABAA reversal potential (EGABA) and worsens seizure activity. Neocortical neuronal membranes have a low water permeability due to the lack aquaporins necessary to move free water. Instead, neurons use cotransport of ions including Cl- to move water. Thus, increasing the extracellular osmolarity during seizures should result in an outward movement of water and salt, reducing [Cl-]i and improving GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition. We tested the effects of hyperosmotic therapy with a clinically relevant dose of mannitol (20 mM) on epileptiform activity, spontaneous multiunit activity, sIPSCs, [Cl-]i, and neuronal volume in layer IV/V of the developing neocortex of C57BL/6 and Clomeleon mice. Using electrophysiological techniques and multiphoton imaging in acute brain slices (post-natal day 7-12) and organotypic neocortical slice cultures (post-natal day 14), we observed that mannitol: 1) decreased epileptiform activity, 2) decreased neuronal volume and [Cl-]i through CCCs, 3) decreased spontaneous multi-unit activity frequency but not amplitude, and 4) restored the anticonvulsant efficacy of the GABAA receptor modulator diazepam. Increasing extracellular osmolarity by 20 mOsm with hypertonic saline did not decrease epileptiform activity. We conclude that an increase in extracellular osmolarity by mannitol mediates the efflux of [Cl-]i and water through CCCs, which results in a decrease in epileptiform activity and enhances benzodiazepine actions in the developing neocortex in vitro. Novel treatments aimed to decrease neuronal volume may concomitantly decrease [Cl-]i and improve seizure control.},

Colonies usually contain 2 reproductives and up to 39 non-breeding siblings, 90\% of whom live a socially-induced lifetime of sterility; they remain in the natal colony, forage for food, defend the colony and care for successive litters. Although there is heightened dispersal following good rainfall, the majority of adult non-reproductives remain in their natal colony and failure to disperse is not directly attributable to habitat saturation or unfavourable soil conditions. A major dispersal event follows the death of a reproductive. Differences in colony cohesion, ethology and the hormonal profiles of non-reproductive animals suggests that eusociality evolved along different pathways in these two phylogenetically divergent genera of the Bathyergidae.},

  abstract = {Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) is a noninvasive optical imaging technique that provides quantitative phase images of living cells. In a recent study, we showed that the quantitative monitoring of the phase signal by DHM was a simple label-free method to study the effects of glutamate on neuronal optical responses (). Here, we refine these observations and show that glutamate produces the following three distinct optical responses in mouse primary cortical neurons in culture, predominantly mediated by NMDA receptors: biphasic, reversible decrease (RD) and irreversible decrease (ID) responses. The shape and amplitude of the optical signal were not associated with a particular cellular phenotype but reflected the physiopathological status of neurons linked to the degree of NMDA activity. Thus, the biphasic, RD, and ID responses indicated, respectively, a low-level, a high-level, and an ``excitotoxic'' level of NMDA activation. Moreover, furosemide and bumetanide, two inhibitors of sodium-coupled and/or potassium-coupled chloride movement strongly modified the phase shift, suggesting an involvement of two neuronal cotransporters, NKCC1 (Na-K-Cl) and KCC2 (K-Cl) in the genesis of the optical signal. This observation is of particular interest since it shows that DHM is the first imaging technique able to monitor dynamically and in situ the activity of these cotransporters during physiological and/or pathological neuronal conditions.},

  abstract = {Naked mole-rats,Heterocephalus glaber, are eusocial, subterranean rodents that inhabit arid regions of northeastern Africa. They feed on bulbs and tubers that are patchily distributed. Nests are often located far from the nearest food source through a labyrinth of tunnels. Two captive colonies were studied to determine whether successful foragers recruit colony mates and, if so, how. Individuals that found a new food source typically gave a special vocalization on their way back to the nest and waved the food around once they got there. Colony mates preferentially visited the site where the initial forager had obtained food, often bypassing alternative sites containing the same type of food. Recruits preferred to use tunnels that had been traversed by the `scout' rather than an alternative pathway to the same food, regardless of whether they had to turn in the same or the opposite direction from that of the scout to enter the previously used pathway. Recruits preferred tunnels that the scout had recently used over tunnels that were recently traversed by another colony mate carrying the same type of food. When tunnels traversed by the scout were replaced with clean substitutes or with tunnels that were recently traversed by another colony mate carrying the same type of food, recruits showed no pathway preferences. Results indicate that naked mole-rats follow each other's (odour) trails to food. There are intriguing parallels between the foraging recruitment system ofH. glaberand those of other social vertebrates and insects.},

  abstract = {1. The effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on membrane potential and conductance as well as on the intracellular Cl- activity (aiCl) and intracellular pH (pHi) were studied in crayfish muscle fibres using a three-microelectrode voltage clamp and ion-selective microelectrodes. In the presence of CO2-HCO3-, the intracellular HCO3- activity (aiHCO3) was estimated from pHi. 2. In a nominally HCO3(-)-free solution, a near-saturating concentration of GABA (0.2 mM) produced a marked increase in membrane conductance but little change in potential. In a solution containing 30 mM-HCO3- (equilibrated with 5\% CO2 + 95\% air; pH 7.4), the GABA-induced increase in conductance was associated with a depolarization of about 15 mV, with an increase in aiCl and with a decrease in aiHCO3. All these effects were blocked by picrotoxin (PTX). The depolarizing action of GABA was augmented following depletion of extracellular and intracellular Cl-. 3. The GABA-induced increase in aiCl which took place in the presence of HCO3- was blocked by clamping the membrane potential at its resting level. This indicates that the increase in aiCl was due to passive redistribution of Cl-. In both the presence and absence of HCO3-, the GABA-activated transmembrane flux of Cl- showed reversal at the level of the resting potential, which indicates that under steady-state conditions the Cl- equilibrium potential (ECl) is identical to the resting potential. 4. In a Cl(-)-free, 30 mM-HCO3(-)-containing solution, 0.5 mM-GABA produced a PTX-sensitive increase in conductance which amounted to 15\% of the conductance activated in the presence of Cl-. In the absence of both Cl- and HCO3-, the respective figure was 2.8\%. Assuming constant-field conditions, the conductance data yielded a permeability ratio PHCO3/PCl of 0.42 for the GABA-activated channels. 5. In a Cl(-)-containing, HCO3(-)-free solution, the reversal potential of the GABA-activated current (EGABA) was, by about 1 mV, less negative than the resting membrane potential (RP). In a solution containing Cl- and 30 mM-HCO3-, EGABA-RP was 12 mV. Simultaneous measurements of EGABA, aiCl and aiHCO3 (pHi) gave a PHCO3/PCl value of 0.33. 6. In a Cl(-)-free, HCO3(-)-containing solution EGABA was close to the HCO3- equilibrium potential (EHCO3) and an experimental acidosis which produced a negative shift in EHCO3 was associated with a similar shift in EGABA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {1. The effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on membrane potential and conductance as well as on the intracellular Cl- activity (aiCl) and intracellular pH (pHi) were studied in crayfish muscle fibres using a three-microelectrode voltage clamp and ion-selective microelectrodes. In the presence of CO2-HCO3-, the intracellular HCO3- activity (aiHCO3) was estimated from pHi. 2. In a nominally HCO3(-)-free solution, a near-saturating concentration of GABA (0.2 mM) produced a marked increase in membrane conductance but little change in potential. In a solution containing 30 mM-HCO3- (equilibrated with 5\% CO2 + 95\% air; pH 7.4), the GABA-induced increase in conductance was associated with a depolarization of about 15 mV, with an increase in aiCl and with a decrease in aiHCO3. All these effects were blocked by picrotoxin (PTX). The depolarizing action of GABA was augmented following depletion of extracellular and intracellular Cl-. 3. The GABA-induced increase in aiCl which took place in the presence of HCO3- was blocked by clamping the membrane potential at its resting level. This indicates that the increase in aiCl was due to passive redistribution of Cl-. In both the presence and absence of HCO3-, the GABA-activated transmembrane flux of Cl- showed reversal at the level of the resting potential, which indicates that under steady-state conditions the Cl- equilibrium potential (ECl) is identical to the resting potential. 4. In a Cl(-)-free, 30 mM-HCO3(-)-containing solution, 0.5 mM-GABA produced a PTX-sensitive increase in conductance which amounted to 15\% of the conductance activated in the presence of Cl-. In the absence of both Cl- and HCO3-, the respective figure was 2.8\%. Assuming constant-field conditions, the conductance data yielded a permeability ratio PHCO3/PCl of 0.42 for the GABA-activated channels. 5. In a Cl(-)-containing, HCO3(-)-free solution, the reversal potential of the GABA-activated current (EGABA) was, by about 1 mV, less negative than the resting membrane potential (RP). In a solution containing Cl- and 30 mM-HCO3-, EGABA-RP was 12 mV. Simultaneous measurements of EGABA, aiCl and aiHCO3 (pHi) gave a PHCO3/PCl value of 0.33. 6. In a Cl(-)-free, HCO3(-)-containing solution EGABA was close to the HCO3- equilibrium potential (EHCO3) and an experimental acidosis which produced a negative shift in EHCO3 was associated with a similar shift in EGABA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

In the present experiments with sharp microelectrodes, whole-cell techniques, and K+-selective microelectrodes, an HFS train (40 pulses at 100 Hz) applied in stratum radiatum close to the recording site evoked a brief hyperpolarizing IPSP (hIPSP), which turned into a prolonged (2-3 sec) depolarization (GABA-mediated depolarizing postsynaptic potential; GDPSP). The I-V relationships of the postsynaptic currents (hIPSC and GDPSC) had distinct characteristics: the hIPSC and the early GDPSC showed outward rectification, whereas the late GDPSC was reduced with positive voltage steps to zero or beyond (inward rectification), but often no clear reversal was seen. That two distinct currents contribute to the generation of the GDPSP was also evident from the finding that a second HFS train at peak or late GDPSP induced a prompt GABAA-mediated hyperpolarization. The GDPSP/C was dependent on the availability of bicarbonate, but not on interstitial or intrapyramidal carbonic anhydrase activity. The HFS train evoked a rapid GABAA-mediated bicarbonate-dependent increase in the extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o), and the GDPSP followed the K+ transient in a sub-Nernstian manner. The spatial and pharmacological characteristics of the [K+]o shift indicated that it is generated by a local network of GABAergic interneurons. The brief ascending phase of the GDPSP is linked to a K+-dependent accumulation of intracellular Cl-.

  abstract = {African mole-rats provide a unique taxonomic group for investigating the evolution and neurobiology of sociality. The two species investigated here display extreme differences in social organization and reproductive strategy. Naked mole-rats (NMRs) live in colonies, dominated by a queen and her consorts; most members remain nonreproductive throughout life but cooperate in burrowing, foraging, and caring for pups, for which they are not biological parents (alloparenting). In contrast, Cape mole-rats (CMRs) are solitary and intolerant of conspecifics, except during fleeting seasonal copulation or minimal maternal behavior. Research on other mammals suggests that oxytocin receptors at various telencephalic sites regulate social recognition, monogamous pair bonding, and maternal/allomaternal behavior. Current paradigms in this field derive from monogamous and polygamous species of New World voles, which are evolutionarily remote from Old World mole-rats. The present findings indicate that NMRs exhibit a considerably greater level of oxytocin receptor (OTR) binding than CMRs in the: nucleus accumbens; indusium griseum; central, medial, and cortical amygdaloid nuclei; bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; and CA1 hippocampal subfield. In contrast, OTR binding in the piriform cortex is intense in CMRs but undetectable in NMRs. We speculate that the abundance of OTR binding and oxytocin-neurophysin-immunoreactive processes in the nucleus accumbens of NMRs reflects their sociality, alloparenting behavior, and potential for reproductive attachments. In contrast, the paucity of oxytocin and its receptors at this site in CMRs may reflect a paucity of prosocial behaviors. Whether similarities in OTR expression between eusocial mole-rats and monogamous voles are due to gene conservation or convergent evolution remains to be determined. J. Comp.

It can live for 30 or more years in atmospheres with low oxygen and high carbon dioxide, and is remarkably resistant to cancer. So the genome sequence, published in this issue, might be expected to contain some intriguing characteristics. Analysis of the genome and its transcriptome reveals unusual genomic features and molecular adaptations including strategies for improved genome stability, low mutation rate and improved protein maintenance. The data also reveal molecular adaptations consistent with poor visual function, poikilothermy, hairlessness, circadian rhythms, taste sensing and insensitivity to low oxygen.},

  abstract = {The voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1) plays an important role in initiating and propagating action potentials in neuronal cells. We and others have recently found that the Alzheimer's disease-related secretases BACE1 and presenilin (PS)/{$\gamma$}-secretase regulate Nav1 function by cleaving auxiliary subunits of the channel complex. We have also shown that elevated BACE1 activity significantly decreases sodium current densities in neuroblastoma cells and acutely dissociated adult hippocampal neurons. For detailed molecular studies of sodium channel regulation, biochemical methods are now complementing classical electrophysiology. To understand how BACE1 regulates sodium current densities in our studies, we setup conditions to analyze surface levels of the pore-forming Nav1 {$\alpha$}-subunits. By using a cell surface biotinylation protocol, we found that elevated BACE1 activity significantly decreases surface Nav1 {$\alpha$}-subunit levels in both neuroblastoma cells and acutely prepared hippocampal slices. This finding would explain the decreased sodium currents shown by standard electrophysiological methods. The biochemical methods used in our studies would be applicable to analyses of surface expression levels of other ion channels as well as Nav1 in cells and adult hippocampal neurons.},

In slices positioned at the gas-liquid interface, hypo-osmotic medium consistently produced a decrease in T and hyperosmotic medium produced an increase in T. The magnitude of {$\Delta$}T was graded as a function of the strength of osmotic change. All changes in T were reversible upon return to isosmotic medium. In contrast, osmotically induced changes in T in submerged slices were consistently opposite in direction to those observed in slices at the interface. The magnitude and direction of {$\Delta$}T could be altered by systematic variation of the level of the bathing medium within the same chamber, indicating that both extrinsic optical properties of various interfaces, such as refraction and reflection, and intrinsic optical properties of the tissue contribute to the observed T. Spectral measurements eliminated the possibility that osmotically induced {$\Delta$}T was the result of changes in light absorbance by intrinsic chromophores such as cytochromes or hemoglobin. The results show that measurements of {$\Delta$}T can be a useful index of changes in cell volume in brain slices, provided that the level of the bath remains constant.},

  abstract = {Hyaluronan (HA) is a key component of the extracellular matrix. Given the fundamental role of HA in the cancer resistance of the naked mole-rat (NMR), we undertook to explore the structural and soft matter properties of this species-specific variant, a necessary step for its development as a biomaterial. We examined HA extracted from NMR brain, lung, and skin, as well as that isolated from the medium of immortalised cells. In common with mouse HA, NMR HA forms a range of assemblies corresponding to a wide distribution of molecular weights. However, unique to the NMR, are highly folded structures, whose characteristic morphology is dependent on the tissue type. Skin HA forms tightly packed assemblies that have spring-like mechanical properties in addition to a strong affinity for water. Brain HA forms three dimensional folded structures similar to the macroscopic appearance of the gyri and sulci of the human brain. Lung HA forms an impenetrable mesh of interwoven folds in a morphology that can only be described as resembling a snowman. Unlike HA that is commercially available, NMR HA readily forms robust gels without the need for chemical cross-linking. NMR HA gels sharply transition from viscoelastic to elastic like properties upon dehydration or repeated loading. In addition, NMR HA can form ordered thin films with an underlying semi-crystalline structure. Given the role of HA in maintaining hydration in the skin it is plausible that the folded structures contribute to both the elasticity and youthfulness of NMR skin. It is also possible that such densely folded materials could present a considerable barrier to cell invasion throughout the tissues, a useful characteristic for a biomaterial.},

  abstract = {The structural properties of brain extracellular space (ECS) are summarised by the tortuosity ({$\lambda$}) and the volume fraction ({$\alpha$}). To determine if these two parameters were independent, we varied the size of the ECS by changing the NaCl content to alter osmolality of bathing media for rat cortical slices. Values of {$\lambda$} and {$\alpha$} were extracted from diffusion measurements using the real-time ionophoretic method with tetramethylammonium (TMA+). In normal medium (305 mosmol kg-1), the average value of {$\lambda$} was 1.69 and of {$\alpha$} was 0.24. Reducing osmolality to 150 mosmol kg-1, increased {$\lambda$} to 1.86 and decreased {$\alpha$} to 0.12. Increasing osmolality to 350 mosmol kg-1, reduced {$\lambda$} to about 1.67 where it remained unchanged even when osmolality increased further to 500 mosmol kg-1. In contrast, {$\alpha$} increased steadily to 0.42 as osmolality increased. Comparison with previously published experiments employing 3000 Mr dextran to measure {$\lambda$}, showed the same behaviour as for TMA+, including the same constant {$\lambda$} in hypertonic media but with a steeper slope in the hypotonic solutions. These data show that {$\lambda$} and {$\alpha$} behave differently as the ECS geometry varies. When {$\alpha$} decreases, {$\lambda$} increases but when {$\alpha$} increases, {$\lambda$} rapidly attains a constant value. A previous model allowing cellular shape to alter during osmotic challenge can account qualitatively for the plateau behaviour of {$\lambda$}.},

  abstract = {Hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid) is a high-molecular-mass polysaccharide found in the extracellular matrix, especially of soft connective tissues. It is synthesized in the plasma membrane of fibroblasts and other cells by addition of sugars to the reducing end of the polymer, whereas the nonreducing end protrudes into the pericellular space. The polysaccharide is catabolized locally or carried by lymph to lymph nodes or the general circulation, from where it is cleared by the endothelial cells of the liver sinusoids. The overall turnover rate is surprisingly rapid for a connective tissue matrix component (t1/2 0.5 to a few days). Hyaluronan has been assigned various physiological functions in the intercellular matrix, e.g., in water and plasma protein homeostasis. Hyaluronan production increases in proliferating cells and the polymer may play a role in mitosis. Extensive hyaluronidase-sensitive coats have been identified around mesenchymal cells. They are either anchored firmly in the plasma membrane or bound via hyaluronan-specific binding proteins (receptors). Such receptors have now been identified on many different cells, e.g., the lymphocyte homing receptor CD 44. Interaction between a hyaluronan receptor and extracellular polysaccharide has been connected with locomotion and cell migration. Hyaluronan seems to play an important role during development and differentiation and has other cell regulatory activities. Hyaluronan has also been recognized in clinical medicine. A concentrated solution of hyaluronan (10 mg/ml) has, through its tissue protective and rheological properties, become a device in ophthalmic surgery. Analysis of serum hyaluronan is promising in the diagnosis of liver disease and various inflammatory conditions, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis. Interstitial edema caused by accumulation of hyaluronan may cause dysfunction in various organs.},

  abstract = {Three hundred and twenty mouse pups of both sexes of the CD-1 outbred strain received IP muscimol and were subsequently assessed for locomotor activity (single Varimex 30-min session) and for hot-plate responding. Muscimol doses were 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 mg/kg at 8 and 14 days, and 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg at 21, 28, and 35 days. Activity data showed a shift from an immature pattern at 8 and 14 days to an adult-like pattern from day 21 onwards (high initial activity followed by a marked within-session decrement). Muscimol was ineffective on day 8, and depressed activity from day 14 onwards.

  abstract = {The potassium chloride cotransporter KCC2 plays a major role in the maintenance of transmembrane chloride potential in mature neurons; thus KCC2 activity is critical for hyperpolarizing membrane currents generated upon the activation of {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid type A and glycine (Gly) receptors that underlie fast synaptic inhibition in the adult central nervous system. However, to date an understanding of the cellular mechanism that neurons use to modulate the functional expression of KCC2 remains rudimentary. Using Escherichia coli expression coupled with in vitro kinase assays, we first established that protein kinase C (PKC) can directly phosphorylate serine 940 (Ser940) within the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of KCC2. We further demonstrated that Ser940 is the major site for PKC-dependent phosphorylation for full-length KCC2 molecules when expressed in HEK-293 cells. Phosphorylation of Ser940 increased the cell surface stability of KCC2 in this system by decreasing its rate of internalization from the plasma membrane. Coincident phosphorylation of Ser940 increased the rate of ion transport by KCC2. It was further evident that phosphorylation of endogenous KCC2 in cultured hippocampal neurons is regulated by PKC-dependent activity. Moreover, in keeping with our recombinant studies, enhancing PKC-dependent phosphorylation increased the targeting of KCC2 to the neuronal cell surface. Our studies thus suggest that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of KCC2 may play a central role in modulating both the functional expression of this critical transporter in the brain and the strength of synaptic inhibition.},

  abstract = {Extracellular space volume fraction, tortuosity and nonspecific uptake of tetramethylammonium--three diffusion parameters of brain tissue--were measured in gray matter of the somatosensory neocortex and subcortical white matter of the rat during postnatal development. The three parameters were determined from concentration-time profiles of tetramethylammonium in postnatal days 2-120 in vivo. Tetramethylammonium concentration was measured with ion-selective microelectrodes positioned 130-200 microns from an iontophoretic source. Data were correlated with cytoarchitectonic structure and average thickness of the regions in 0-90-day-old rats using rapidly frozen tissue. Extracellular space volume fraction was largest in the newborn rats and diminished with age. In two-to three-day-old animals, volume fraction (mean +/- S.E.) was 0.36 +/- 0.04 in layers III and IV, 0.38 +/- 0.02 in layer V, 0.41 +/- 0.01 in layer VI and 0.46 +/- 0.01 in white matter. The earliest decrease in volume fraction was found in layers V and VI at postnatal days 6-7 followed by a decrease in layer III and IV at postnatal days 8-9 and in white matter at postnatal days 10-11. A further dramatic reduction in volume fraction occurred in all cortical layers and especially in the white matter between postnatal days 10 and 21. There was no further decrease in volume fraction between postnatal day 21 and adults (90-120 days old). The adult volume fraction values were: layer II, 0.19 +/- 0.002; III, 0.20 +/- 0.004; IV, 0.21 +/- 0.003; V, 0.22 +/- 0.003; VI, 0.23 +/- 0.007; white matter, 0.20 +/- 0.008. Values of tortuosity ranged between 1.51 and 1.65, nonspecific cellular uptake varied from 3.3 x 10(-3)/s to 6.3 x 10(-3)/s. The variations in each parameter were not statistically significant at any age. These data represent the first characterization of diffusion parameters in a developing brain. They confirm previous histological indications of a relatively large extracellular volume fraction during early postnatal development. The constancy of the tortuosity shows that diffusion of small molecules is no more hindered in the developing brain than in the adult. The large extracellular space volume fraction of the neonatal brain could significantly dilute ions, metabolites and neuroactive substances released from cells, relative to release in adults, and may be a factor in preventing anoxia, seizure and spreading depression in young animals. The diffusion characteristics could also play an important role in the developmental process itself.},

  abstract = {Oxytocin and its receptor (Oxtr) play a crucial role in the postnatal transition of neuronal GABA neurotransmission from excitatory to inhibitory, a developmental process known as the GABA switch. Using hippocampal neurons from Oxtr-null mice, we show that (1) Oxtr is necessary for the correct timing of the GABA switch by upregulating activity of the chloride cotransporter~KCC2, (2) Oxtr, in a very early and narrow time window, directly modulates the functional activity of KCC2 by promoting its phosphorylation and insertion/stabilization at the neuronal surface, and (3) in the absence of Oxtr, electrophysiological alterations are recorded in mature neurons, a finding consistent with a reduced level of KCC2 and increased susceptibility to seizures observed in adult Oxtr-null mice. These data identify KCC2 as a key target of oxytocin in postnatal events that may be linked to pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.,

In this study, we have investigated the expression patterns of members of the cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs), including the K-Cl cotransporters KCC1-4 and the Na-K-2 Cl cotranporter NKCC1 during rodent embryonic brain development. At the time of neurogenesis (embryonic days; E12.5\textendash 14.5), KCC1 was only detectable in the developing choroid plexus. KCC2 mRNA was detectable as early as E12.5 in the ventral part of the (cervical) spinal cord, and by E14.5, the expression had spread to TUJ1-positive differentiating regions of the rhombencephalon, diencephalon and olfactory bulb, in parallel with neuronal maturation. KCC3 mRNA was scarce in the cortical plate at E14.5, and slightly up-regulated at birth. In contrast, KCC4 mRNA was abundantly expressed in the ventricular zone and was down-regulated perinatally. At E14.5, NKCC1 was highly expressed in the vimentin-positive radial glia of the proliferative zone of the subcortical region. At later embryonic stages, during gliogenesis (E17-P0), there was a shift in NKCC1 expression to the neuron specific Class III {$\beta$}-tubulin ({$\beta$}III) positive region of the cortical plate. These unique spatiotemporal expression patterns of distinct CCCs during embryonic development suggests that Cl\textendash{} regulatory mechanisms are critically involved in the control of neuronal development.},

The model suggests that the principal benefit of group foraging is a reduction in foraging risk, rather than increased resource procurement per se. Meeting the energetic costs of non-workers in social groups necessitates a reduction of the total energetic expenditure of the colony. This is achieved by reducing body size, huddling in the nest, and scaling mass-specific resting metabolic rate virtually independent of mass.},

  abstract = {The foraging behaviour and diets of the various bathyergid molerat species are reviewed briefly, and inferences are drawn concerning their dietary specialisation. A simple model has been constructed which investigates the risks of unproductive foraging by specialist feeders as a function of resource dispersion characteristics and group size. The model suggests that the principal benefit of group foraging is a reduction in foraging risk, rather than increased resource procurement per se. Meeting the energetic costs of non-workers in social groups necessitates a reduction of the total energetic expenditure of the colony. This is achieved by reducing body size, huddling in the nest, and scaling mass-specific resting metabolic rate virtually independent of mass.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that cotransporters transport water in addition to their normal substrates, although the precise mechanism is debated; both active and passive modes of transport have been suggested. The magnitude of the water flux mediated by cotransporters may well be significant: both the number of cotransporters per cell and the unit water permeability are high. For example, the Na+-glutamate cotransporter (EAAT1) has a unit water permeability one tenth of that of aquaporin (AQP) 1. Cotransporters are widely distributed in the brain and participate in several vital functions: inorganic ions are transported by K+\textendash Cl- and Na+\textendash K+\textendash Cl- cotransporters, neurotransmitters are reabsorbed from the synaptic cleft by Na+-dependent cotransporters located on glial cells and neurons, and metabolites such as lactate are removed from the extracellular space by means of H+-lactate cotransporters. We have previously determined water transport capacities for these cotransporters in model systems (Xenopus oocytes, cell cultures, and in vitro preparations), and will discuss their role in water homeostasis of the astroglial cell under both normo- and pathophysiologal situations. Astroglia is a polarized cell with EAAT localized at the end facing the neuropil while the end abutting the circulation is rich in AQP4. The water transport properties of EAAT suggest a new model for volume homeostasis of the extracellular space during neural activity.},

We used a microfiberoptic epifluorescence photobleaching method to determine the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in macromolecule diffusion deep in tumor tissue. In subcutaneous B16 tumors in living mice, translational diffusion of 10 kDa FITC-dextran was slowed 2- to 3-fold (compared with its diffusion in water) within a depth of 0.2 mm from the tumor surface, but {$>$}10-fold beyond a depth of 1 mm. Diffusion of larger macromolecules, FITC-albumin and 500 kDa FITC-dextran, was slowed by up to 40-fold at 0.5 mm and 300-fold at 2 mm. Intratumoral collagenase (to digest collagen) or cathespin C (to digest decorin) each increased diffusion of 10 kDa FITC-dextran by {$\sim$}2-fold. However, these treatments dramatically increased diffusion ({$>$}10-fold) of larger macromolecules, such as 500 kDa dextran, in deep tumor (2 mm depth). Intratumoral hyaluronidase, in contrast, slowed diffusion throughout the tumor. In vitro measurements in defined gel-like mixtures of collagen, hyaluronan, and decorin closely recapitulated results in tumors in vivo. Mathematical modeling quantified the roles of extracellular space volume fraction and dimensions, and indicated a substantial effect of cell density on diffusion in deep tumor. Our data define the determinants of diffusion in deep tumor and suggest collagen and decorin digestion to greatly facilitate macromolecule delivery.\textemdash Magzoub, M., Jin, S., Verkman, A. S.

  abstract = {Stroke is one of the major causes of death and disability worldwide. The major type of stroke is an ischaemic one, which is caused by a blockage that interrupts blood flow to the brain. There are currently very few pharmacological strategies to reduce the damage and social burden triggered by this pathology. The harm caused by the interruption of blood flow to the brain unfolds in the subsequent hours and days, so it is critical to identify new therapeutic targets that could reduce neuronal death associated with the spread of the damage. Here, we review some of the key molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of neuronal death, focusing on some new and promising studies. In particular, we focus on the potential of the chloride co-transporter (CCC) family of proteins, mediators of the GABAergic response, both during the early and later stages of stroke, to promote neuroprotection and recovery. Different studies of CCCs during the chronic and recovery phases post-stroke reveal the importance of timing when considering CCCs as potential neuroprotective and/or neuromodulator targets. The molecular regulatory mechanisms of the two main neuronal CCCs, NKCC1 and KCC2, are further discussed as an indirect approach for promoting neuroprotection and neurorehabilitation following an ischaemic insult. Finally, we mention the likely importance of combining different strategies in order to achieve more effective therapies.},

Recombinant PKC isozymes alpha, beta 1, delta, epsilon, and zeta were used in in vitro kinase assays to investigate G\"o 6976 with respect to isozyme-specific PKC inhibition. G\"o 6850, identical with GF 109203X, another PKC-specific kinase inhibitor, was included in this study as a reference compound. Nanomolar concentrations of the indolocarbazole G\"o 6976 inhibited the Ca(2+)-dependent isozymes alpha and beta 1, whereas even micromolar concentration of G\"o 6976 had no effect on the kinase activity of the Ca(2+)-independent PKC subtypes delta, epsilon, and zeta. In contrast, the bisindolymaleimide G\"o 6850 inhibited all PKC isozymes, however, with a ranked order of potency (alpha {$>$} beta 1 {$>$} epsilon {$>$} delta {$>$} zeta). Kinetic analysis revealed that PKC inhibition by G\"o 6976 was competitive with respect to ATP, non-competitive with respect to the protein substrate, and mixed type with respect to phosphatidylserine. Further experiments in the presence of different amounts of free Ca2+ indicated that interference with Ca2+ or its binding site is not responsible for the differential inhibition of PKC isozymes by G\"o 6976.},

Clinical data, neuroimaging records, and seizure outcomes were abstracted from medical records and confirmed with patient and family contacts. Hippocampal neuron losses and mossy fiber reactive synaptogenesis were quantified independently. Results showed that the type of initial precipitating injury and the patient's age at which it occurred were related to the clinicopathological features of TLE. An initial precipitating injury occurred in 18 patients (90\%), all of whom had mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). Patients with a prolonged initial seizure or a nonseizure initial precipitating injury before age 5 years were significantly more likely to have unilateral hippocampal atrophy (p {$<$} 0.05) shown on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and had significantly greater inner molecular layer mossy fiber puncta densities (p {$<$} 0.001) than patients with nonprolonged childhood initial precipitating injuries and/or seizures after age 5 years. Furthermore, nonseizure injuries in patients before age 5 years had significantly longer latent periods (p {$<$} 0.05), and the patients did not respond to surgical treatment as well as other MTS patients. Those with an initial precipitating injury after age 5 years had MTS but showed significantly less inner molecular layer mossy fiber sprouting (p {$<$} 0.05) than patients whose injuries appeared before age 5 years. Patients without an initial precipitating injury (idiopathic TLE) had significantly fewer neuron losses (p {$<$} 0.05) and inner molecular layer mossy fiber puncta densities (p {$<$} 0.05) and had worse outcomes following en bloc temporal lobectomy compared to patients with MTS who had experienced initial precipitating injuries. Patients with unilateral hippocampal abnormalities on MR imaging did not show significant differences in neuron losses or aberrant mossy fiber puncta densities compared to patients without asymmetry. These results support the hypothesis that the type of initial precipitating injury and the age at which the injury occurred initiates and influences the pathophysiological process that eventually develops into MTS. These data support the notion that the pathophysiology of hippocampal damage and mossy fiber sprouting after an initial precipitating injury may be a progressive process.},

  abstract = {In addition to its potent effects on vasculature, it has become clear that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has effects on both neurons and glia, and recent studies suggest that it can be neuroprotective. To determine potential mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection, recombinant human VEGF was bath applied to adult rat hippocampal slices, and both extracellular and intracellular recordings were used to examine intrinsic properties and synaptic responses of hippocampal principal neurons. Initial studies in area CA1 showed that VEGF significantly reduced the amplitude of responses elicited by Schaffer collateral stimulation, without influencing membrane properties. Similar effects occurred in CA3 pyramidal cells and dentate gyrus granule cells when their major glutamatergic afferents were stimulated. Because VEGF expression is increased after seizures, effects of VEGF were also examined in rats with recurrent spontaneous seizures. VEGF reduced spontaneous discharges in slices from these rats but had surprisingly little effect on epileptiform discharges produced by disinhibition of slices from control rats. These results demonstrate a previously unknown effect of VEGF on neuronal activity and also demonstrate a remarkable potency in the epileptic brain. Based on this, we suggest that VEGF or VEGF-related targets could provide useful endpoints to direct novel therapeutic strategies for epilepsy.},

The burrows of these rodents are in well\textemdash drained soils of poor water\textemdash holding capacity. Burrow atmospheres have an oxygen concentration of 15 to 20\%, a carbon dioxide concentration of 0.5 to 2.0\%, and limited temperature fluctuations; they are saturated with water vapor. Body temperature are somewhat low (35 to 37\textdegree C) in four species; temperature regulation is good in these species at ambient temperature down to 5 or 10\textdegree C. Heterocephalus, however, has a much lower body temperature (about 32\textdegree C) and the poorest capacity for thermoregulation of any known mammal. Fossorial rodents have low basal rates of metabolism, high conductances, and high ranges of thermoneutrality. Lethal ambient temperatures are inversely proportional to the normal levels of body temperature. Analysis of basal rates of metabolism (M), conductances (C), and body temperature suggests that the first two are determined in relation to environmental characteristics, and that body temperature, "goodness" of thermoregulation, midpoint of thermoneutrality, and lethal ambient temperature are dependent upon the ratio M/C. It is concluded that the lowest body temperature in homoiotherms compatible with good thermoregulation is about 35\textdegree C. A comparison of Heterocephalus and lizards illustrates the energetic similarities and differences between endotherms and ectotherms. The reduction of M and the increase of C in fossorial rodents are directly related to the mean burrow temperatures. These modifications reduce the probability of overheating in an environment where evaporative and convective cooling are greatly reduced. Tachyoryctes and Heliophobius use forced evaporative cooling for emergency thermoregulation, in spite of the saturated burrow atmosphere. Heterocephalus facilitates heat loss during heat stress by increasing peripheral circulation over its naked body; Geomys does this by increasing the circulation to its naked tail and, possibly, naked feet. Geomys may lose up to 30\% of its heat production via its tail. As a result of these modifications, the lethal ambient temperature is proportional to the mean burrow temperature. Geomys responds to geographic variation in heat loading either by a decrease in body size or by an increase in tail length. The smaller size of nonpregnant, female gophers helps to maintain their heat production during pregnancy below the limits established by the environment for males. Gopher distribution appears to be limited to soils with high rates of gas exchange. Interaction among species of gophers has, to some extent, a physiological basis. It is suggested that the physiological characters concerned with energetics are readily modified, in an evolutionary sense, to conform to the requirements imposed by the environment.},

  abstract = {Transition from homeostatic to reactive matrix remodeling is a fundamental adaptive tissue response to injury, inflammatory disease, fibrosis and cancer. Alterations in architecture, physical properties and matrix composition result in changes in biomechanical and biochemical cellular signaling. The dynamics of pericellular and extracellular matrices, including matrix protein, proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan modification are continually emerging as essential regulatory mechanisms underlying cellular and tissue function. Nevertheless, the impact of matrix organization on inflammation and immunity in particular, and the consequent effects on tissue healing and disease outcome are arguably under-studied aspects of adaptive stress responses. Herein, we review how the predominant glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) contributes to the structure and function of the tissue microenvironment. Specifically, we examine the evidence of HA degradation and the generation of biologically-active smaller HA fragments in pathological settings in vivo. We discuss how HA fragments versus nascent HA via alternate receptor-mediated signaling influence inflammatory cell recruitment and differentiation, resident cell activation, as well as tumor growth, survival and metastasis. Finally, we discuss how HA fragmentation impacts restoration of normal tissue function and pathological outcomes in disease.},

  abstract = {The neuropeptide oxytocin regulates a wide variety of social behaviors across diverse species. However, the types of behaviors that are influenced by this hormone are constrained by the species in question and the social organization that a particular species exhibits. Therefore, the present experiments investigated behaviors regulated by oxytocin in a eusocial mammalian species by using the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber). In Experiment 1, adult non-breeding mole-rats were given intraperitoneal injections of either oxytocin (1mg/kg or 10mg/kg) or saline on alternate days. Animals were then returned to their colony and behavior was recorded for minutes 15\textendash 30 post-injection. Both doses of oxytocin increased huddling behavior during this time period. In Experiment 2, animals received intraperitoneal injections of either oxytocin (1mg/kg), an oxytocin-receptor antagonist (0.1mg/kg), a cocktail of oxytocin and the antagonist, or saline across 4 testing days in a counterbalanced design. Animals were placed in either a 2-chamber arena with a familiar conspecific or in a small chamber with 1week old pups from their home colony and behaviors were recorded for minutes 15\textendash 30 post-injection. Oxytocin increased investigation of, and time spent in close proximity to, a familiar conspecific; these effects were blocked by the oxytocin antagonist. No effects were seen on pup-directed behavior. These data suggest that oxytocin is capable of modulating affiliative-like behavior in this eusocial species.},

  abstract = {Eusocial insects often display a certain degree of task specialization, which may help maximize the efficiency of a colony. Here we tested for the presence of task specialization in a eusocial mammal. Naked mole-rats, Heterocephalus glaber, were videorecorded across multiple days in their home colony and in a neutral arena with an unfamiliar conspecific for determination of short-term behavioural profiles. They were also recorded in these settings across the birth of multiple litters to assess the stability of behaviour patterns over months. Pup care behaviour, working behaviour and colony defence were unevenly distributed among subordinate mole-rats. Furthermore, these behaviours were stable across days and months. Across days, age was positively related to colony defence and negatively related to pup carrying. We also tested whether behaviours were stable across contexts by observing pup care behaviour outside of the colony in a neutral arena. We further attempted to determine whether mole-rats' behaviours were contingent on the demands of the colony by removing the most frequent performers of pup care, colony defence and work behaviour from each colony. Results from these experiments suggest that when task specialists were no longer present, remaining animals adjusted their behaviour to fill the needs of the colony. Under these circumstances, younger animals engaged in the majority of working and pup-carrying behaviour while older animals engaged in the majority of colony defence behaviours. Thus, subordinate naked mole-rats show both task specialization and task switching.},

Evidence of increased glycolytic flux due to anaerobic metabolism is found at thicknesses greater than 600? in association with a progressive increase in the inulin-exclusion space. The metabolic profiles, as a function of depth into the slices, reveal that 700-? slices function in a manner similar to 540-? slices at the surfaces, but with a core of increased 2DG phosphorylation at the slice center. In contrast, the 1000-? slices show significant reductions of 2DG and increases in 2DG6P relative to the 540-? slices at the slice surface as well as in the slice interior, suggesting impaired transport of 2DG into cells and spread of ischemic injury from the slice interior to the slice surface. Despite these metabolic changes, only minor morphologic changes of ischemic injury were found at the center of thicker slices, and in vitro glucose utilization of 1000-? slices remained constant for up to 15 h. These three slice thicknesses should provide a useful model for studying the neurochemistry and neuropharmacology of the ischemic penumbra.},

  abstract = {Diffusion plays a crucial role in brain function. The spaces between cells can be likened to the water phase of a foam and many substances move within this complicated region. Diffusion in this interstitial space can be accurately modelled with appropriate modifications of classical equations and quantified from measurements based on novel micro-techniques. Besides delivering glucose and oxygen from the vascular system to brain cells, diffusion also moves informational substances between cells, a process known as volume transmission. Deviations from expected results reveal how local uptake, degradation or bulk flow may modify the transport of molecules. Diffusion is also essential to many therapies that deliver drugs to the brain. The diffusion-generated concentration distributions of well-chosen molecules also reveal the structure of brain tissue. This structure is represented by the volume fraction (void space) and the tortuosity (hindrance to diffusion imposed by local boundaries or local viscosity). Analysis of these parameters also reveals how the local geometry of the brain changes with time or under pathological conditions. Theoretical and experimental approaches borrow from classical diffusion theory and from porous media concepts. Earlier studies were based on radiotracers but the recent methods use a point-source paradigm coupled with micro-sensors or optical imaging of macromolecules labelled with fluorescent tags. These concepts and methods are likely to be applicable elsewhere to measure diffusion properties in very small volumes of highly structured but delicate material.},

  abstract = {With the projected levels of global warming and ocean acidification, fishes have to face warmer waters with CO2 levels that are the highest in over 30 million years. The resultant rise in body temperature means that metabolic rates of fish will increase, and some may become energetically compromised. No less worrying, and maybe more surprising, is that rising CO2 concentrations appear to trigger pH regulatory mechanisms that disrupts neural ion gradients, leading to altered neurotransmitter function and maladaptive behavioral changes. We point out the many outstanding questions, including the ultimate one: Will fish be able to adapt to these challenges?},

Moving from the evidence that excitatory neurotransmission drives changes in KCC2 expression in cerebellar neurons, we studied the regulation of KCC2 expression by group-I metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors in the cerebellum of adult mice. Mice lacking mGlu5 receptors showed a large reduction in cerebellar KCC2 protein levels and a loss of KCC2 immunoreactivity in Purkinje cells. Similar changes were seen in mice treated with the mGlu5 receptor antagonist, MPEP, whereas treatment with the mGlu5 receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM), VU0360172, increased KCC2 expression. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of mGlu1 receptors with JNJ16259685 enhanced cerebellar KCC2 protein levels and KCC2 immunoreactivity in Purkinje cells, whereas treatment with the mGlu1 receptor PAM, RO0711401, reduced KCC2 expression. To examine whether the reduction in KCC2 expression caused by the absence or the inhibition of mGlu5 receptors could affect GABAergic transmission, we performed electrophysiological and behavioral studies. Recording of extracellular action potentials in Purkinje cells showed that the inhibitory effect of the GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol, was lost in cerebellar slices prepared from mGlu5(-/-) mice or from mice treated systemically with MPEP, in line with the reduction in KCC2 expression. Similarly, motor impairment caused by the GABAA receptor PAM, diazepam, was attenuated in mice pre-treated with MPEP. These findings disclose a novel function of mGlu5 receptors in the cerebellum and suggest that mGlu5 receptor ligands might influence GABAergic transmission in the cerebellum and affect motor responses to GABA-mimetic drugs.

  abstract = {This review describes the basic concepts and protocol to perform the real-time iontophoresis (RTI) method, the gold-standard to explore and quantify the extracellular space (ECS) of the living brain. The ECS surrounds all brain cells and contains both interstitial fluid and extracellular matrix. The transport of many substances required for brain activity, including neurotransmitters, hormones, and nutrients, occurs by diffusion through the ECS. Changes in the volume and geometry of this space occur during normal brain processes, like sleep, and pathological conditions, like ischemia. However, the structure and regulation of brain ECS, particularly in diseased states, remains largely unexplored. The RTI method measures two physical parameters of living brain: volume fraction and tortuosity. Volume fraction is the proportion of tissue volume occupied by ECS. Tortuosity is a measure of the relative hindrance a substance encounters when diffusing through a brain region as compared to a medium with no obstructions. In RTI, an inert molecule is pulsed from a source microelectrode into the brain ECS. As molecules diffuse away from this source, the changing concentration of the ion is measured over time using an ion-selective microelectrode positioned roughly 100 \textmu m away. From the resulting diffusion curve, both volume fraction and tortuosity can be calculated. This technique has been used in brain slices from multiple species (including humans) and in vivo to study acute and chronic changes to ECS. Unlike other methods, RTI can be used to examine both reversible and irreversible changes to the brain ECS in real time.},

Similarities in the selective environment between naked mole-rats and eusocial insect species highlight the selective conditions under which queen/worker castes are predicted to evolve in animal societies.},

Intriguingly, fully-grown naked mole-rats (NMRs) exhibit many traits typical of neonatal rodents. However, little is known about NMR growth and maturation, and we question whether sustained neotenous features when compared to mice, reflect an extended developmental period, commensurate with their exceptionally long life. We tracked development from birth to three years of age in the slowest maturing organ, the brain, by measuring mass, neural stem cell proliferation, axonal and dendritic maturation, synaptogenesis and myelination. NMR brain maturation was compared to data from similar sized rodents, mice, and to that of long-lived mammals, humans and non-human primates. We found that at birth, NMR brains are significantly more developed than mice, and rather are more similar to those of newborn primates, with clearly laminated hippocampi and myelinated white matter tracts. Despite this more mature brain at birth than mice, postnatal NMR brain maturation occurs at a far slower rate than mice, taking four-times longer than required for mice to fully complete brain development. At four months of age, NMR brains reach 90\% of adult size with stable neuronal cytostructural protein expression whereas myelin protein expression does not plateau until nine months of age in NMRs, and synaptic protein expression continues to change throughout the first three years of life. Intriguingly, NMR axonal composition is more similar to humans than mice whereby NMRs maintain expression of three-repeat (3R) tau even after brain growth is complete; mice experience an abrupt downregulation of 3R tau by postnatal day 8 which continues to diminish through six weeks of age. We have identified key ages in NMR cerebral development and suggest that the long-lived NMR may provide neurobiologists an exceptional model to study brain developmental processes that are compressed in common short-lived laboratory animal models.},

  abstract = {Gramicidin perforated-patch-clamp recordings in brain slices were used to obtain an accurate assessment of the developmental change in the GABAA receptor reversal potential (EGABAA) in embryonic and early postnatal rat neocortical cells including neuroepithelial precursor cells, cortical plate neurons, and postnatal neocortical neurons. Our results demonstrate that there is a progressive negative shift inEGABAA, with the most positive values found in the youngest cortical precursor cells. At the early stages of neocortical development,EGABAA is determined by the chloride (Cl-) gradient, and the internal chloride concentration ([Cl-]i) decreases with development.EGABAA is positive to the resting potential, indicating that GABA serves to depolarize developing neocortical cells. Consistent with this conclusion, GABAAreceptor activation with muscimol was found to increase the internal calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in both embryonic and early postnatal neocortical cells through the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Postnatal cells exhibit spontaneous postsynaptic synaptic currents, which are eliminated by bicuculline methiodide (BMI) but not glutamate receptor antagonists and reverse at the Cl- equilibrium potential. Likewise, brief spontaneous increases in [Ca2+]i, sensitive to BMI and TTX, are observed at the same ages, suggesting that endogenous synaptic GABAA receptor activation can depolarize cells and activate VGCCs. These results suggest that GABAA receptor-mediated depolarization may influence early neocortical developmental events, including neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, through the activation of Ca2+-dependent signal transduction pathways.},

Using whole-animal plethysmography and open-flow respirometry, we examined the hypoxic metabolic response (HMR), hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) and hypoxic thermal response in awake, freely behaving naked mole rats exposed to 7\% O2 for 1 h. Metabolic rate and ventilation each reversibly decreased 70\% in hypoxia (from 39.6 {$\pm$} 2.9 to 12.1 {$\pm$} 0.3 ml O2 min-1 kg-1, and 1412 {$\pm$} 244 to 417 {$\pm$} 62 ml min-1 kg-1, respectively; p {$<$} 0.05), whereas body temperature was unchanged and animals remained awake and active. Subcutaneous injection of the general adenosine receptor antagonist aminophylline (AMP; 100 mg kg-1, in saline), but not control saline injections, prevented the HVR but had no effect on the HMR. As a result, AMP-treated naked mole rats exhibited extreme hyperventilation in hypoxia. These animals were also less tolerant to hypoxia, and in some cases hypoxia was lethal following AMP injection. We conclude that in naked mole rats (i) hypoxia tolerance is partially dependent on profound hypoxic metabolic and ventilatory responses, which are equal in magnitude but occur independently of thermal changes in hypoxia, and (ii) adenosine receptors mediate the HVR but not the HMR.},

  abstract = {Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) commonly arise following early-life long seizures, and especially febrile status epilepticus (FSE). However, there are major gaps in our knowledge regarding the causal relationships of FSE, TLE, HS and cognitive disturbances that hamper diagnosis, biomarker development and prevention. The critical questions include: What is the true probability of developing TLE after FSE? Are there predictive markers for those at risk? A fundamental question is whether FSE is simply a marker of individuals who are destined to develop TLE, or if FSE contributes to the risk of developing TLE. If FSE does contribute to epileptogenesis, then does this happen only in the setting of a predisposed brain? These questions are addressed within this review, using information gleaned over the past two decades from clinical studies as well as animal models.},

Over its full length, the amino acid sequence of KCC2 is 67\% identical to the widely distributed K-Cl cotransporter isoform (KCC1) identified in rat brain and rabbit kidney (Gillen, C., Brill, S., Payne, J.A., and Forbush, B., III (1996) J.

Two stably transfected HEK-293 cell lines were prepared: one expressing an epitope-tagged KCC2 (KCC2\textendash 22T) and another expressing the unaltered KCC2 (KCC2\textendash 9). The KCC2\textendash 22T cells produced a glycoprotein of {$\sim$}150 kDa that was absent from HEK-293 control cells. The 86Rb influx in both cell lines was significantly greater than untransfected control HEK-293 cells.

  abstract = {The widely accepted oxidative stress theory of aging postulates that aging results from accumulation of oxidative damage. Surprisingly, data from the longest-living rodent known, naked mole-rats [MRs; mass 35 g; maximum lifespan (MLSP) {$>$} 28.3 years], when compared with mice (MLSP 3.5 years) exhibit higher levels of lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and DNA oxidative damage even at a young age. We hypothesize that age-related changes in protein structural stability, oxidation, and degradation are abrogated over the lifespan of the MR. We performed a comprehensive study of oxidation states of protein cysteines [both reversible (sulfenic, disulfide) and indirectly irreversible (sulfinic/sulfonic acids)] in liver from young and old C57BL/6 mice (6 and 28 months) and MRs (2 and {$>$}24 years). Furthermore, we compared interspecific differences in urea-induced protein unfolding and ubiquitination and proteasomal activity. Compared with data from young mice, young MRs have 1.6 times as much free protein thiol groups and similar amounts of reversible oxidative damage to cysteine. In addition, they show less urea-induced protein unfolding, less protein ubiquitination, and higher proteasome activity. Mice show a significant age-related increase in cysteine oxidation and higher levels of ubiquitination. In contrast, none of these parameters were significantly altered over 2 decades in MRs. Clearly MRs have markedly attenuated age-related accrual of oxidation damage to thiol groups and age-associated up-regulation of homeostatic proteolytic activity. These pivotal mechanistic interspecies differences may contribute to the divergent aging profiles and strongly implicate maintenance of protein stability and integrity in successful aging.},

In fact, the strategy is much older and was mentioned by greats such as Francis Bacon (1561\textendash 1626), Aristoteles (384\textendash 322 BC), and Eryximachus (late-fifth century bce). Hypoventilation to reduce central nervous system excitability was used in antiquity as evidenced by Cyriacus' treatment of Artemia, the daughter of Emperor Diocletian ({$\approx$} 244\textendash 311). She was suffering from (among others) seizures that Cyriacus was apparently controlling by tightening a scarf around her neck, as depicted by Mathias Gr\"unewald (1460\textendash 1528) on a wing of the so-called Heller Altar now on display at the Historical Museum, Frankfurt, Germany. In modern times, around 1920, inducing hypercapnia by CO2 inhalation as therapy for hiccups was suggested and tried by a number of anesthetists, such as Americans Russel Firth Sheldon (1885\textendash 1960) and Brian Collins Sword (1889\textendash 1956) in Boston; Briton Christopher Langton Hewer (1896\textendash 1986) at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London; Austrian Karl Doppler (1887\textendash 1947) in Vienna; and the German/Polish Arthur Dzialoszynski (1893\textendash 1977) in Berlin. Although various authors assign the scientific primate to any of them, the first mention of carbon dioxide inhalation as treatment of singultus in the scientific literature is of French origin and was made by Paris pharmacist Henri Bocquillon-Limousin (1856\textendash 1917) in his 1892 Formulaire des m\'edicaments nouveaux et des m\'edications nouvelles.},

  abstract = {Panic disorder (PD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by recurrent discrete episodes of fear accompanied by a variety of physiological and psychological symptoms, often with prominent respiratory components. A series of clinical observations has led some investigators to hypothesize that subtle alterations in ventilatory regulation are integral to at least a subtype of PD. In order to identify genetic factors that might predispose individuals to these alterations in ventilatory response, we conducted single stranded conformation polymorphism analysis across the exons of the lactate dehydrogenase A and B genes (LDHA and LDHB) using DNA prepared from 86 subjects previously characterized by respiratory response to a CO2 challenge with a variable genetic loading for PD. Remarkably, a single conserved LDHA exon 5 haplotype conferred increased risk for a paradoxical ventilatory response pattern to CO2 inhalation which robustly separated well subjects at high risk for PD from low-risk control subjects.

  abstract = {Panic disorder (PD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by recurrent discrete episodes of fear accompanied by a variety of physiological and psychological symptoms, often with prominent respiratory components. A series of clinical observations has led some investigators to hypothesize that subtle alterations in ventilatory regulation are integral to at least a subtype of PD. In order to identify genetic factors that might predispose individuals to these alterations in ventilatory response, we conducted single stranded conformation polymorphism analysis across the exons of the lactate dehydrogenase A and B genes (LDHA and LDHB) using DNA prepared from 86 subjects previously characterized by respiratory response to a CO2 challenge with a variable genetic loading for PD. Remarkably, a single conserved LDHA exon 5 haplotype conferred increased risk for a paradoxical ventilatory response pattern to CO2 inhalation which robustly separated well subjects at high risk for PD from low-risk control subjects. But, comparison of LDHA exon 5 genotypes in PD probands (n\,=\,25) to that of random newborn controls (n\,=\,182) did not demonstrate any significant differences. Given the pivotal role of LDH in the metabolism of lactate, a known inducer of panic attacks, and the dependence of LDH activity on cell pH, we suggest that LDHA polymorphisms may contribute to the variability to CO2 respiratory challenge. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Recently, considerable attention has been focused on the cation-chloride cotransporters Na-K-Cl cotransporter isoform I (NKCC-1) and K-Cl cotransporter isoform II (KCC2), as they may play an important role in the disruption of ion gradients and subsequent ischemic damage. In this study, we examined the ability of cation-chloride transport inhibitors to influence the biochemical (i.e. ATP) and histological recovery of neurons in adult hippocampal slices exposed to OGD. In the hippocampus, 7 min of OGD caused a loss of ATP that recovered partially (approximately 50\%) during 3 h of reoxygenation. Furosemide, which inhibits the NKCC-1 and KCC2 cotransporters, and bumetanide, a more specific NKCC-1 inhibitor, enhanced ATP recovery when measured 3 h after OGD. Furosemide and bumetanide also attenuated area CA1 neuronal injury after OGD. However, higher concentrations of these compounds appear to have additional non-specific toxic effects, limiting ATP recovery following OGD and promoting neuronal injury. The KCC2 cotransporter inhibitor DIOA and the Cl(-) ATPase inhibitor ethacrynic acid caused neuronal death even in the absence of OGD and promoted cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria, indicating non-specific toxicities of these compounds.},

  abstract = {Febrile seizures are the most common type of convulsive events in children. It is generally assumed that the generalization of these seizures is a result of brainstem invasion by the initial limbic seizure activity. Using precollicular transection in 13-day-old rats to isolate the forebrain from the brainstem, we demonstrate that the forebrain is not required for generation of tonic\textendash clonic convulsions induced by hyperthermia or kainate. Compared with sham-operated littermate controls, latency to onset of convulsions in both models was significantly shorter in pups that had undergone precollicular transection, indicating suppression of the brainstem seizure network by the forebrain in the intact animal. We have shown previously that febrile seizures are precipitated by hyperthermia-induced respiratory alkalosis. Here, we show that triggering of hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation and consequent convulsions in transected animals are blocked by diazepam. The present data suggest that the role of endogenous brainstem activity in triggering tonic\textendash clonic seizures should be re-evaluated in standard experimental models of limbic seizures. Our work sheds new light on the mechanisms that generate febrile seizures in children and, therefore, on how they might be treated.},

J Appl Physiol 85: 575\textendash 583). We studied the effect of hyaluronidase on the diffusion of albumin. Isolated rabbit lungs were inflated with silicon rubber by way of airways and blood vessels, and two chambers were bonded to the sides of a {$\sim$}0.5-cm thick slab enclosing a vessel with an interstitial cuff. One chamber was filled with 2 g/dl albumin solution containing 125I-albumin and 0.02 g/dl hyaluronidase. Unbound 125I was removed from the tracer by dialysis before use. The other chamber filled with Ringer's solution was placed within a NaI(Tl) scintillation detector. Diffusion of tracer was measured continuously for 120 h. Albumin diffusion coefficient (D) and interstitial area (A) were obtained by fitting the tracer-time curve with the theoretical solution of the equation describing one-dimension diffusion of a solute across a membrane. D averaged 5.2 \texttimes{} 10-7 cm2/s for albumin diffusion with hyaluronidase, 20\% less than that measured previously without hyaluronidase. Hyaluronidase had no effect on A. Results indicated an interaction between albumin and interstitial hyaluronan that was the opposite of the steric effect on albumin excluded volume measured in solution.},

  abstract = {Febrile seizures are the most common seizure type in children, and hyperthermia may contribute to seizure generation during fever. We have previously demonstrated that hyperthermia suppressed {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons of immature rats. However, whether this suppression is age-dependent is unknown. Moreover, it is unclear whether hyperthermia has differential effects on neuronal inhibition in CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) and dentate gyrus granule cells (GCs). In this study, we investigated the effects of hyperthermia on GABAA and GABAB receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in CA1 and DG neurons from immature (11\textendash 17 days old) and mature (6\textendash 8 weeks old) rats using whole-cell recordings in vitro. In immature rats, hyperthermia decreased the peak amplitude of GABAA receptor-mediated IPSCs (GABAA IPSCs) in PCs but not in GCs. However, hyperthermia decreased the decay time constant of GABAA IPSCs to a similar extent in both PCs and GCs. In mature rats, hyperthermia decreased the peak amplitude but not the decay time constant of GABAA IPSCs in both PCs and GCs. Hyperthermia decreased charge transfer (area) of the GABAA IPSC of PCs more in immature than in mature rats. In contrast, hyperthermia decreased the GABAB receptor-mediated IPSCs to the same degree in immature and mature rats, for either CA1 or DG neurons. Because the hippocampus has been found to be involved in hyperthermia-induced behavioral seizures in immature rats, we suggest that the higher sensitivity of CA1 inhibitory synaptic function to hyperthermia in immature compared with mature rats might partially explain the higher susceptibility for febrile seizures in immature animals. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {A wide variety of organisms exhibit various circadian rhythms in their behavior and physiology. Circadian rhythms are regulated by internal clocks that are generally entrained primarily by the environmental light:dark (L:D) cycle. There have been few studies of circadian rhythms in fossorial species that inhabit an environment where day-night variations are minimal and where exposure to light occurs infrequently. In this study, circadian patterns of wheel-running activity were examined in naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber). Naked mole-rats are fossorial and eusocial, living in colonies of 60-70 animals with only one breeding female. Most individual mole-rats that ran on wheels (65\%) exhibited robust circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, entrained to various L:D cycles, and free-ran in constant darkness (DD) with taus averaging 23.5 h. The remainder of the animals either free-ran or were arrhythmic under the various L:D cycles. Mole-rats generally failed to entrain to non-24-h T-cycles with period lengths ranging from T=23 h to T=25 h. There was considerable inter-individual variation in the circadian patterns of locomotor activity in naked mole-rats as is observed in other subterranean mammals that have been studied. In contrast to the results obtained when mole-rats were individually housed with access to running wheels, circadian rhythms of general locomotor activity were typically not observed for animals monitored while they were housed in a colony setting. However, clear nocturnal rhythms of general locomotor activity were displayed by four males while residing in their home colonies. Two of these males exhibited the physical appearance of a disperser morph - subordinate individuals that are believed to leave their home colonies to achieve reproductive opportunities elsewhere. All four of these males were among the largest males in their respective colonies. These results demonstrate that although naked mole-rats are not frequently exposed to light, the species has retained the capacity to exhibit locomotor patterns of circadian rhythmicity and has the ability to entrain to 24-h L:D cycles. The possible adaptive function of this circadian capacity is discussed.},

  abstract = {GABA ({$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid) is the main inhibitory transmitter in the adult brain, and it exerts its fast hyperpolarizing effect through activation of anion (predominantly Cl-)-permeant GABAA receptors1. However, during early neuronal development, GABA A-receptor-mediated responses are often depolarizing2,3, which may be a key factor in the control of several Ca2+-dependent developmental phenomena, including neuronal proliferation, migration and targeting4,5,6. To date, however, the molecular mechanism underlying this shift in neuronal electrophysiological phenotype is unknown. Here we show that, in pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus, the ontogenetic change in GABAA-mediated responses from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing is coupled to a developmental induction of the expression of the neuronal Cl--extruding K+/Cl- co-transporter, KCC2 (ref. 7). Antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of KCC2 expression produces a marked positive shift in the reversal potential of GABAA responses in functionally mature hippocampal pyramidal neurons. These data support the conclusion that KCC2 is the main Cl- extruder to promote fast hyperpolarizing postsynaptic inhibition in the brain.},

  abstract = {GABAergic signalling has the unique property of 'ionic plasticity', which is based on short-term and long-term changes in the Cl(-) and HCO(3)(-) ion concentrations in the postsynaptic neurones. While short-term ionic plasticity is caused by activity-dependent, channel-mediated anion shifts, long-term ionic plasticity depends on changes in the expression patterns and kinetic regulation of molecules involved in anion homeostasis. During development the efficacy and also the qualitative nature (depolarization/excitation versus hyperpolarization/inhibition) of GABAergic transmission is influenced by the neuronal expression of two key molecules: the chloride-extruding K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter KCC2, and the cytosolic carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoform CAVII. In rat hippocampal pyramidal neurones, a steep up-regulation of KCC2 accounts for the 'developmental switch', which converts depolarizing and excitatory GABA responses of immature neurones to classical hyperpolarizing inhibition by the end of the second postnatal week. The immature hippocampus generates large-scale network activity, which is abolished in parallel by the up-regulation of KCC2 and the consequent increase in the efficacy of neuronal Cl(-) extrusion. At around postnatal day 12 (P12), an abrupt, steep increase in intrapyramidal CAVII expression takes place, promoting excitatory responses evoked by intense GABAergic activity. This is largely caused by a GABAergic potassium transient resulting in spatially widespread neuronal depolarization and synchronous spike discharges. These facts point to CAVII as a putative target of CA inhibitors that are used as antiepileptic drugs. KCC2 expression in adult rat neurones is down-regulated following epileptiform activity and/or neuronal damage by BDNF/TrkB signalling. The lifetime of membrane-associated KCC2 is very short, in the range of tens of minutes, which makes KCC2 ideally suited for mediating GABAergic ionic plasticity. In addition, factors influencing the trafficking and kinetic modulation of KCC2 as well as activation/deactivation of CAVII are obvious candidates in the ionic modulation of GABAergic responses. The down-regulation of KCC2 under pathophysiological conditions (epilepsy, damage) in mature neurones seems to reflect a 'recapitulation' of early developmental mechanisms, which may be a prerequisite for the re-establishment of connectivity in damaged brain tissue.},

Febrile seizures frequently recur, with a recurrence rate of 33 percent overall and 50 percent when the first febrile seizure occurs before one year of age1. The risk of recurrence increases when there is a family history of febrile seizures and, in some but not all studies, when there is a family history of afebrile seizures and when the child has a neurologic abnormality2,3. Half the recurrences occur within six months of the first febrile . . .},

  abstract = {Brain carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are known to modulate neuronal signalling. Using a novel CA VII (Car7) knockout (KO) mouse as well as a CA II (Car2) KO and a CA II/VII double KO, we show that mature hippocampal pyramidal neurons are endowed with two cytosolic isoforms. CA VII is predominantly expressed by neurons starting around postnatal day 10 (P10). The ubiquitous isoform II is expressed in neurons at P20. Both isoforms enhance bicarbonate-driven GABAergic excitation during intense GABAA-receptor activation. P13\textendash 14 CA VII KO mice show behavioural manifestations atypical of experimental febrile seizures (eFS) and a complete absence of electrographic seizures. A low dose of diazepam promotes eFS in P13\textendash P14 rat pups, whereas seizures are blocked at higher concentrations that suppress breathing. Thus, the respiratory alkalosis-dependent eFS are exacerbated by GABAergic excitation. We found that CA VII mRNA is expressed in the human cerebral cortex before the age when febrile seizures (FS) occur in children. Our data indicate that CA VII is a key molecule in age-dependent neuronal pH regulation with consequent effects on generation of FS., Carbonic anhydrase VII plays a key role in age-dependent neuronal pH regulation, promoting excitatory GABA transmission and febrile seizures.},

The effects of pH changes on neuronal excitability are mediated by diverse, largely synergistically-acting mechanisms operating at the level of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels and gap junctions. In general, alkaline shifts induce an increase in excitability which is often intense enough to trigger epileptiform activity, while acidosis has the opposite effect.

Thirteen catalytically-active mammalian carbonic anhydrase isoforms have been identified, whereof 11 are expressed in the brain. Distinct CA isoforms which have their catalytic sites within brain cells and the interstitial fluid exert a remarkably strong influence on the dynamics of pH shifts and, consequently, on neuronal functions. In this review, we will discuss the various roles of H(+) as an intra- and extracellular signaling factor in the brain, focusing on the effects mediated by CAs. Special attention is paid on the developmental expression patterns and actions of the neuronal isoform, CA VII. Studies on the various functions of CAs will shed light on fundamental mechanisms underlying neuronal development, signaling and plasticity; on pathophysiological mechanisms associated with epilepsy and related diseases; and on the modes of action of CA inhibitors used as CNS-targeting drugs.},

Whole exome sequencing (WES) in ten sporadic and one familial case of EIMFS revealed compound heterozygous SLC12A5 (encoding the neuronal K+-Cl- co-transporter KCC2) mutations in two families: c.279\,+\,1G\,{$>$}\,C causing skipping of exon 3 in the transcript (p.E50\_Q93del) and c.572\,C\,{$>$}T (p.A191V) in individuals 1 and 2, and c.967T\,{$>$}\,C (p.S323P) and c.1243\,A\,{$>$}\,G (p.M415V) in individual 3. Another patient (individual 4) with migrating multifocal seizures and compound heterozygous mutations [c.953G\,{$>$}\,C (p.W318S) and c.2242\_2244del (p.S748del)] was identified by searching WES data from 526 patients and SLC12A5-targeted resequencing data from 141 patients with infantile epilepsy. Gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp analysis demonstrated strongly suppressed Cl- extrusion function of E50\_Q93del and M415V mutants, with mildly impaired function of A191V and S323P mutants. Cell surface expression levels of these KCC2 mutants were similar to wildtype KCC2. Heterologous expression of two KCC2 mutants, mimicking the patient status, produced a significantly greater intracellular Cl- level than with wildtype KCC2, but less than without KCC2. These data clearly demonstrated that partially disrupted neuronal Cl- extrusion, mediated by two types of differentially impaired KCC2 mutant in an individual, causes EIMFS.},

  abstract = {The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which mediates the body's response to stress, is largely under GABAergic control. Here we demonstrate that corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons are modulated by the stress-derived neurosteroid, tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC), acting on {$\delta$} subunit-containing GABAA receptors (GABAARs). Under normal conditions, THDOC potentiates the inhibitory effects of GABA on CRH neurons, decreasing the activity of the HPA axis. Counterintuitively, following stress, THDOC activates the HPA axis due to dephosphorylation of KCC2 residue Ser940, resulting in a collapse of the chloride gradient and excitatory GABAergic transmission. The effects of THDOC on CRH neurons are mediated by actions on GABAAR {$\delta$} subunit-containing receptors since these effects are abolished in Gabrd-/- mice under both control and stress conditions. Interestingly, blocking neurosteroidogenesis with finasteride is sufficient to block the stress-induced elevations in corticosterone and prevent stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors in mice. These data demonstrate that positive feedback of neurosteroids onto CRH neurons is required to mount the physiological response to stress. Further, GABAAR {$\delta$} subunit-containing receptors and phosphorylation of KCC2 residue Ser940 may be novel targets for control of the stress response, which has therapeutic potential for numerous disorders associated with hyperexcitability of the HPA axis, including Cushing's syndrome, epilepsy, and major depression.},

They exert wide-ranging effects on synaptic signaling and plasticity and on development and disorders of the brain. The ideal technique to elucidate the underlying ionic mechanisms is quantitative and combined two-photon imaging of [Cl-]i and pHi, but this has never been performed at the cellular level in vivo. Here, by using a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor that includes a spectroscopic reference (an element insensitive to Cl- and pH), we show that ratiometric imaging is strongly affected by the optical properties of the brain. We have designed a method that fully corrects for this source of error. Parallel measurements of [Cl-]i and pHi at the single-cell level in the mouse cortex showed the in vivo presence of the widely discussed developmental fall in [Cl-]i and the role of the K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 in this process. Then, we introduce a dynamic two-photon excitation protocol to simultaneously determine the changes of pHi and [Cl-]i in response to hypercapnia and seizure activity.},

                    (complex) febrile seizures are associated with an increased susceptibility to

                    have been extensively studied in rat pups exposed to hyperthermia. The

                    is known to enhance neuronal excitability. Here we show that hyperthermia causes

                    0.2\textendash 0.3 pH units for seizure induction. Suppressing alkalosis with
                    5\% ambient CO2 abolished seizures within 20 s.
                    CO2 also prevented two long-term effects of hyperthermic seizures in

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Febrile seizures (FS) are the most common type of convulsive events in children. FS are suggested to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. However, the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying FS remain unclear. Using an animal model of experimental FS, it was demonstrated that hyperthermia causes respiratory alkalosis with consequent brain alkalosis and seizures. Here we examine the acid-base status of children who were admitted to the hospital for FS. Children who were admitted because of gastroenteritis (GE), a condition known to promote acidosis, were examined to investigate a possible protective effect of acidosis against FS.
METHODS: We enrolled 433 age-matched children with similar levels of fever from two groups presented to the emergency department. One group was admitted for FS (n = 213) and the other for GE (n = 220). In the FS group, the etiology of fever was respiratory tract infection (74.2\%), otitis media (7\%), GE (7\%), tonsillitis (4.2\%), scarlet fever (2.3\%) chickenpox (1.4\%), urinary tract infection (1.4\%), postvaccination reaction (0.9\%), or unidentified (1.4\%). In all patients, capillary pH and blood Pco(2) were measured immediately on admission to the hospital.
KEY FINDINGS: Respiratory alkalosis was found in children with FS (pH 7.46 {$\pm$} 0.04, [mean {$\pm$} standard deviation] Pco(2) 29.5 {$\pm$} 5.5 mmHg), whereas a metabolic acidosis was seen in all children admitted for GE (pH 7.31 {$\pm$} 0.03, Pco(2) 37.7 {$\pm$} 4.3 mmHg; p {$<$} 0.001 for both parameters). No FS were observed in the latter group. A subgroup (n = 15; 7\%) of the patients with FS had GE and, notably, their blood pH was more alkaline (pH 7.44 {$\pm$} 0.04) than in the GE-admitted group. During the enrollment period, eight of the patients were admitted on separate occasions because of FS or GE. Consistent with the view that generation of FS requires a genetic susceptibility in addition to acute seizure triggering factors, each of these patients had an alkalotic blood pH when admitted because of FS, whereas they had an acidotic pH (and no FS) when admitted because of GE (pH 7.47 {$\pm$} 0.05 vs. pH 7.33 {$\pm$} 0.03, p {$<$} 0.005).
SIGNIFICANCE: The results show that FS are associated with a systemic respiratory alkalosis, irrespective of the severity of the underlying infection as indicated by the level of fever. The lack of FS in GE patients is attributable to low pH, which also explains the fact that children with a susceptibility to FS do not have seizures when they have GE-induced fever that is associated with acidosis. The present demonstration of a close link between FS and respiratory alkalosis may pave the way for further clinical studies and attempts to design novel therapies for the treatment of FS by controlling the systemic acid-base status.},

  abstract = {The naked mole-rat is the longest living rodent with a maximum lifespan exceeding 28 years. In addition to its longevity, naked mole-rats have an extraordinary resistance to cancer as tumors have never been observed in these rodents. Furthermore, we show that a combination of activated Ras and SV40 LT fails to induce robust anchorage-independent growth in naked mole-rat cells, while it readily transforms mouse fibroblasts. The mechanisms responsible for the cancer resistance of naked mole-rats were unknown. Here we show that naked mole-rat fibroblasts display hypersensitivity to contact inhibition, a phenomenon we termed "early contact inhibition." Contact inhibition is a key anticancer mechanism that arrests cell division when cells reach a high density. In cell culture, naked mole-rat fibroblasts arrest at a much lower density than those from a mouse. We demonstrate that early contact inhibition requires the activity of p53 and pRb tumor suppressor pathways. Inactivation of both p53 and pRb attenuates early contact inhibition. Contact inhibition in human and mouse is triggered by the induction of p27(Kip1). In contrast, early contact inhibition in naked mole-rat is associated with the induction of p16(Ink4a). Furthermore, we show that the roles of p16(Ink4a) and p27(Kip1) in the control of contact inhibition became temporally separated in this species: the early contact inhibition is controlled by p16(Ink4a), and regular contact inhibition is controlled by p27(Kip1). We propose that the additional layer of protection conferred by two-tiered contact inhibition contributes to the remarkable tumor resistance of the naked mole-rat.},

Nearly blind and virtually hairless, naked mole-rats inhabit large subterranean colonies in which only one female and her one to three mates conceive offspring, while the young from previous litters maintain and defend the group as do workers in colonies of the social insects. In this first major treatise on naked mole-rats an international group of researchers covers such topics as the evolution of eusociality, phylogeny and systematics of the rodent family Bathyergidae, population and behavioral ecology and genetics of naked mole-rats in the field, vocal and nonvocal behaviors, social organization and divisions of labor within colonies, and climatic, social, and physiological factors affecting growth, reproduction, and reproductive suppression.

  abstract = {The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA), a component of the extracellular matrix, has been implicated in regulating neural differentiation, survival, proliferation, migration, and cell signaling in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). HA is found throughout the CNS as a constituent of proteoglycans, especially within perineuronal nets that have been implicated in regulating neuronal activity. HA is also found in the white matter where it is diffusely distributed around astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Insults to the CNS lead to long-term elevation of HA within damaged tissues, which is linked at least in part to increased transcription of HA synthases. HA accumulation is often accompanied by elevated expression of at least some transmembrane HA receptors including CD44. Hyaluronidases that digest high molecular weight HA into smaller fragments are also elevated following CNS insults and can generate HA digestion products that have unique biological activities. A number of studies, for example, suggest that both the removal of high molecular weight HA and the accumulation of hyaluronidase-generated HA digestion products can impact CNS injuries through mechanisms that include the regulation of progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation. These studies, reviewed here, suggest that targeting HA synthesis, catabolism, and signaling are all potential strategies to promote CNS repair.},

Acid inhibition of voltage-gated sodium currents is more profound in naked mole-rat nociceptors than in mouse nociceptors, however, which effectively prevents acid-induced action potential initiation. We describe a species-specific variant of the nociceptor sodium channel Na(V)1.7, which is potently blocked by protons and can account for acid insensitivity in this species. Thus, evolutionary pressure has selected for an Na(V)1.7 gene variant that tips the balance from proton-induced excitation to inhibition of action potential initiation to abolish acid nociception.},

We describe a species-specific variant of the nociceptor sodium channel Na(V)1.7, which is potently blocked by protons and can account for acid insensitivity in this species. Thus, evolutionary pressure has selected for an Na(V)1.7 gene variant that tips the balance from proton-induced excitation to inhibition of action potential initiation to abolish acid nociception.},

We characterized the transport activity and regulation by pH(i) of full-length AE3 and the cardiac isoform, AE3c, both of which are expressed in the heart. AE3c is an N-terminal variant of AE3. We also characterized AE1, AE2 and a deletion construct (AE3tr) coding for the common region of AE3 and AE3c. AE proteins were expressed by transient transfection of HEK-293 cells, and transport activity was monitored by following changes of intracellular pH or intracellular chloride concentration associated with anion exchange. Transport activities, measured as proton flux (mM H(+).min(-1)), were as follows: AE1, 24; AE2, 32; full-length AE3, 9; AE3c, 4 and AE3tr, 4. The wide range of transport activities is not explained by variation of cell surface processing since approx. 30\% of each isoform was expressed on the cell surface. pH(i) was clamped at a range of values from 6.0-9.0 to examine regulation of AE proteins by pH(i). Whereas AE2 was steeply inhibited by acid pH(i), AE1, AE3 and AE3c were essentially insensitive to changes of pH(i). We conclude that AE3 and AE3c can contribute to pH(i) recovery after cellular-acid loading.},

To determine whether cell surface-anchored carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIV) interacts with AE proteins to accelerate the bicarbonate transport rate, AE1-mediated bicarbonate transport was monitored in transfected HEK293 cells. Expression of the inactive CAII V143Y mutant blocked the interaction between endogenous cytosolic CAII and AE1, AE2, and AE3 and inhibited their transport activity (53 {$\pm$} 3, 49 {$\pm$} 10, and 35 {$\pm$} 1\% inhibition, respectively). However, in the presence of V143Y CAII, expression of CAIV restored full functional activity to AE1, AE2, and AE3 (AE1, 101 {$\pm$} 3; AE2, 85 {$\pm$} 5; AE3, 108 {$\pm$} 1\%). In Triton X-100 extracts of transfected HEK293 cells, resolved by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, CAIV recruitment to the position of AE1 suggested a physical interaction between CAIV and AE1. Gel overlay assays showed a specific interaction between CAIV and AE1, AE2, and AE3. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays revealed that the interaction between CAIV and AE1 occurs on the large fourth extracellular loop of AE1. We conclude that AE1 and CAIV interact on extracellular loop 4 of AE1, forming the extracellular component of a bicarbonate transport metabolon, which accelerates the rate of AE-mediated bicarbonate transport.},

Here we show recessive loss-of-function SLC12A5 mutations in patients with a severe infantile-onset pharmacoresistant epilepsy syndrome, epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS). Decreased KCC2 surface expression, reduced protein glycosylation and impaired chloride extrusion contribute to loss of KCC2 activity, thereby impairing normal synaptic inhibition and promoting neuronal excitability in this early-onset epileptic encephalopathy., The potassium-chloride co-transporter, KCC2 is an essential component in maintaining a gradient for chloride ions in neurons. Here Stodberg and colleagues identify loss-of-function mutations in the encoding gene SLC12A5, which impair normal synaptic function associated with early-onset epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity in the brain extracellular space is attributable mainly to isoforms CA4 and CA14. In brain, these enzymes have been studied mostly in the context of buffering activity-dependent extracellular pH transients. Yet evidence from others has suggested that CA4 acts in a complex with anion exchangers (AEs) to facilitate Cl-\textendash HCO3- exchange in cotransfected cells. To investigate whether CA4 or CA14 plays such a role in hippocampal neurons, we studied NH4+-induced alkalinization of the cytosol, which is mitigated by Cl- entry and HCO3- exit. The NH4+-induced alkalinization was enhanced when the extracellular CAs were inhibited by the poorly permeant CA blocker, benzolamide, or by inhibitory antibodies specific for either CA4 or CA14. The NH4+-induced alkalinization was also increased with inhibition of anion exchange by 4,4*-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2*-disulfonic acid, or by eliminating Cl- from the medium. No effect of benzolamide was seen under these conditions, in which no Cl-\textendash HCO3- exchange was possible. Quantitative PCR on RNA from the neuronal cultures indicated that AE3 was the predominant AE isoform. Single-cell PCR also showed that Slc4a3 (AE3) transcripts were abundant in isolated neurons. In hippocampal neurons dissociated from AE3-null mice, the NH4+-induced alkalinization was much larger than that seen in neurons from wild-type mice, suggesting little or no Cl-\textendash HCO3- exchange in the absence of AE3. Benzolamide had no effect on the NH4+-induced alkalinization in the AE3 knock-out neurons. Our results indicate that CA4 and CA14 both play important roles in the regulation of intracellular pH in hippocampal neurons, by facilitating AE3-mediated Cl-\textendash HCO3- exchange.},

  abstract = {Background
Naked mole-rats are eusocial mammals, living in large colonies with a single breeding female and 1\textendash 3 breeding males. Breeders are socially dominant, and only the breeders exhibit traditional sex differences in circulating gonadal steroid hormones and reproductive behaviors. Non-reproductive subordinates also fail to show sex differences in overall body size, external genital morphology, and non-reproductive behaviors. However, subordinates can transition to breeding status if removed from their colony and housed with an opposite-sex conspecific, suggesting the presence of latent sex differences. Here, we assessed the expression of steroid hormone receptor and aromatase messenger RNA (mRNA) in the brains of males and females as they transitioned in social and reproductive status.

Methods
We compared in-colony subordinates to opposite-sex subordinate pairs that were removed from their colony for either 1~day, 1~week, 1~month, or until they became breeders (i.e., produced a litter). Diencephalic tissue was collected and mRNA of androgen receptor (Ar), estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1), progesterone receptor (Pgr), and aromatase (Cyp19a1) was measured using qPCR. Testosterone, 17{$\beta$}-estradiol, and progesterone from serum were also measured.

Results
As early as 1~week post-removal, males exhibited increased diencephalic Ar mRNA and circulating testosterone, whereas females had increased Cyp19a1 mRNA in the diencephalon. At 1~month post-removal, females exhibited increased 17{$\beta$}-estradiol and progesterone. The largest changes in steroid hormone receptors were observed in breeders. Breeding females had a threefold increase in Cyp19a1 and fivefold increases in Esr1 and Pgr, whereas breeding males had reduced Pgr and increased Ar.

Conclusions
These data demonstrate~that sex differences in circulating gonadal steroids and hypothalamic gene expression emerge weeks to months after subordinate animals are removed from reproductive suppression in their home colony.},

The contributions of {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors to posttetanic excitation of CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices were studied using extracellular and intracellular recording techniques. Synaptic responses were evoked on tetanic stimulation (100\textendash 200 Hz, 40\textendash 100 pulses) applied in stratum radiatum close (300\textendash 600 {$\mu$}m) to the recording site. Under control conditions, tetanic stimulation resulted in a triphasic depolarization/hyperpolarization/sustained depolarization sequence in area CA1 pyramidal cells. The late depolarization usually gave rise to a prolonged ({$\leq$}3 s) spike firing. The late depolarization and the associated spike firing were blocked both specifically and completely (within a time window of 3\textendash 6 min starting from picrotoxin application) by the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin (PiTX, 100 {$\mu$}M). Paradoxically, at this early stage of PiTX application, overall neuronal firing was attenuated to a higher degree than what was achieved by ionotropic glutamate antagonists. Complete block of ionotropic glutamate receptors by the antagonists d-2-amino-5-phosphonopentoate (AP5, 80 {$\mu$}M), 6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX, 10 {$\mu$}M), and ketamine (50 {$\mu$}M) blocked the initial fast depolarization and suppressed the late one. Exposure to a permeable inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, ethoxyzolamide (EZA, 50 {$\mu$}M) inhibited the late, apparently GABA-mediated depolarization. It is concluded that GABA can provide the main posttetanic excitatory drive in the adult hippocampus. The present results suggest that intense activation of GABAergic interneurons may accentuate the excitation of principal neurons and, hence, play an important facilitatory role in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and epileptogenesis.},

However, it is unclear if exceptional polymer length of vHMM-HA is important for longevity. Here, we show that vHMM-HA ({$>$}6.1 MDa) has superior cytoprotective properties compared to the shorter HMM-HA. It protects not only NMR cells, but also mouse and human cells from stress-induced cell-cycle arrest and cell death in a polymer length-dependent manner. The cytoprotective effect is dependent on the major HA-receptor, CD44. We find that vHMM-HA suppresses CD44 protein-protein interactions, whereas HMM-HA promotes them. As a result, vHMM-HA and HMM-HA induce opposing effects on the expression of CD44-dependent genes, which are associated with the p53 pathway. Concomitantly, vHMM-HA partially attenuates p53 and protects cells from stress in a p53-dependent manner. Our results implicate vHMM-HA in anti-aging mechanisms and suggest the potential applications of vHMM-HA for enhancing cellular stress resistance.},

The pattern of KCC2 expression during early brain development suggests that its upregulation drives the postsynaptic switch of GABA from excitation to inhibition. We previously found decreased expression of full-length KCC2 in the postmortem hippocampus of patients with schizophrenia, but not in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Using PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we discovered several previously unrecognized alternative KCC2 transcripts in both human adult and fetal brain in addition to the previously identified full-length (NM\_020708.3) and truncated (AK098371) transcripts. We measured the expression levels of four relatively abundant truncated splice variants, including three novel transcripts ({$\Delta$}EXON6, EXON2B, and EXON6B) and one previously described transcript (AK098371), in a large human cohort of nonpsychiatric controls across the lifespan, and in patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders. In SH-SY5Y cell lines, these transcripts were translated into proteins and expressed at their predicted sizes. Expression of the EXON6B transcript is increased in the DLPFC of patients with schizophrenia (p = 0.03) but decreased in patients with major depression (p = 0.04). The expression of AK098371 is associated with a GAD1 single nucleotide polymorphism (rs3749034) that previously has been associated with GAD67 expression and risk for schizophrenia. Our data confirm the developmental regulation of KCC2 expression, and provide evidence that KCC2 transcripts are differentially expressed in schizophrenia and affective disorders. Alternate transcripts from KCC2 may participate in the abnormal GABA signaling in the DLPFC associated with schizophrenia.},

Central administration of NPY or synthetic ligands for its receptors has indicated a role of NPY in anxiety-related behaviors, feeding, regulation of blood pressure, circadian rhythm and other functions. Some limitations inherent in pharmacological approaches, such as lack of selectivity of receptor antagonists, can be elegantly circumvented using genetically modified animals. For NPY, mice lacking NPY, the Y1, the Y2 or the Y5 receptors have been generated. In addition, both mice and rats overexpressing NPY in the central nervous system are available. Here, we review the research carried out so far in the NPY-field using genetically modified animals. Together, these models indicate that stress-related behaviors and regulation of voluntary alcohol intake perhaps are among the most important functions of central NPY, and may provide attractive targets for developing novel therapies in depression, anxiety disorders and alcohol dependence.},

  abstract = {Purpose
CO2 has been long recognized for its anticonvulsant properties. We aimed to determine whether inhaling 5\% CO2 can be used to suppress seizures in epilepsy patients. The effect of CO2 on cortical epileptic activity accompanying behavioral seizures was studied in rats and a non-human primate and based on these data, preliminary tests were carried out in humans.

Methods
In freely moving rats, cortical afterdischarges paralleled by myoclonic convulsions were evoked by sensorimotor cortex stimulation. 5\% CO2 was applied for 5 minutes, 3 minutes before stimulation. In macaque monkeys, hypercarbia was induced by hypoventilation while seizure activity was electrically or chemically evoked in the sensorimotor cortex. Seven patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy were examined with video-EEG and received 5\% CO2 in medical carbogen shortly after electrographic seizure onset.

Results
In rats, 5\% CO2 strongly suppressed cortical afterdischarges, by ca. 75\%, while responses to single-pulse stimulation were reduced by about 15\% only. In macaques, increasing pCO2 from 37 to 44-45 mmHg (corresponding to inhalation of 5\% CO2 or less) suppressed stimulation-induced cortical afterdischarges by about 70\% and single, bicuculline-induced epileptiform spikes by ca. 25\%. In a pilot trial carried out in 7 patients, a rapid termination of electrographic seizures was seen despite the fact that the application of 5\% CO2 was started after seizure generalization.

Conclusions
5\% CO2 has a fast and potent anticonvulsant action. The present data suggest that medical carbogen with 5\% CO2 can be used for acute treatment to suppress seizures in epilepsy patients.},

Despite the physiological importance, the underlying mechanisms of this developmental phenomenon are poorly understood. Using perforated-patch, whole cell, and cell-attached recordings, we measured the membrane potential in CA3 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices from postnatal rats. With gramicidin perforated-patch recordings, membrane potential was \textendash 44 {$\pm$} 4 (SE) mV at postnatal days P0\textendash P2, and it progressively shifted to \textendash 67 {$\pm$} 2 mV at P13\textendash 15. A similar developmental change of the membrane potential has been also observed with conventional whole cell recordings. However, the value of the membrane potential deduced from the reversal potential of N-methyl-d-aspartate channels in cell-attached recordings did not change with age and was \textendash 77 {$\pm$} 2 mV at P2 and \textendash 77 {$\pm$} 2 mV at P13\textendash 14. The membrane potential measured using whole cell recordings correlated with seal and input resistance, being most depolarized in neurons with high, several gigaohms, input resistance and low seal resistance. Simulations revealed that depolarized values of the membrane potential in whole cell and perforated-patch recordings could be explained by a shunt through the seal contact between the pipette and membrane. Thus the membrane potential of CA3 pyramidal cells appears to be strongly negative at birth and does not change during postnatal development.},

In vivo administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist before delivery prevented the switch of GABA actions in fetal neurons and aggravated the severity of anoxic episodes. Thus, maternal oxytocin inhibits fetal neurons and increases their resistance to insults during delivery.},

  abstract = {Febrile seizures (FS) are the most prevalent seizures in children. Although FS are largely benign, complex FS increase the risk to develop temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Studies in rat models for FS have provided information about functional changes in the hippocampus after complex FS. However, our knowledge about the genes and pathways involved in the causes and consequences of FS is still limited. To enable molecular, genetic and knockout studies, we developed and characterized an FS model in mice and used it as a phenotypic screen to analyze FS susceptibility. Hyperthermia was induced by warm air in 10- to 14-day-old mice and induced FS in all animals. Under the conditions used, seizure-induced behavior in mice and rats was similar. In adulthood, treated mice showed increased hippocampal Ih current and seizure susceptibility, characteristics also seen after FS in rats. Of the seven genetically diverse mouse strains screened for FS susceptibility, C57BL/6J mice were among the most susceptible, whereas A/J mice were among the most resistant. Strains genetically similar to C57BL/6J also showed a susceptible phenotype. Our phenotypic data suggest that complex genetics underlie FS susceptibility and show that the C57BL/6J strain is highly susceptible to FS. As this strain has been described as resistant to convulsants, our data indicate that susceptibility genes for FS and convulsants are distinct. Insight into the mechanisms underlying seizure susceptibility and FS may help to identify markers for the early diagnosis of children at risk for complex FS and TLE and may provide new leads for treatment.},

Here we show that these [K(+)](o) responses induced by high-frequency stimulation or GABA(A) agonist application are generated by the neuronal K(+)-Cl() cotransporter KCC2 and that the transporter-mediated KCl extrusion is critically dependent on the bicarbonate-driven accumulation of Cl() in pyramidal neurons. The mechanism underlying GABAergic [K(+)](o) transients was studied in CA1 stratum pyramidale using intracellular sharp microelectrodes and extracellular ion-sensitive microelectrodes. The evoked [K(+)](o) transients, as well as the associated afterdischarges, were strongly suppressed by 0.5-1 mm furosemide, a KCl cotransport inhibitor. Importantly, the GABA(A)R-mediated intrapyramidal accumulation of Cl(), as measured by monitoring the reversal potential of fused IPSPs, was unaffected by the drug. It was further confirmed that the reduction in the [K(+)](o) transients was not due to effects of furosemide on the Na(+)-dependent K(+)-Cl() cotransporter NKCC1 or on intraneuronal carbonic anhydrase activity. Blocking potassium channels by Ba(2+) enhanced [K(+)](o) transients whereas pyramidal cell depolarizations were attenuated in further agreement with a lack of contribution by channel-mediated K(+) efflux. The key role of the GABA(A)R channel-mediated anion fluxes in the generation of the [K(+)](o) transients was examined in experiments where bicarbonate was replaced with formate. This anion substitution had no significant effect on the rate of Cl() accumulation, [K(+)](o) response or afterdischarges. Our findings reveal a novel excitatory mode of action of KCC2 that can have substantial implications for the role of GABAergic transmission during ictal epileptiform activity.},

Hypoxia and tissue acidosis have been proposed to increase physiological CA activity in various compartments of the body. We hypothesized that CA activity in blood is upregulated in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).Design:Cross-sectional analysis of a sleep clinic cohort.Settings:Sleep laboratory at a university hospital.Participants:Seventy referred patients with suspected OSA (48 males, age 54 {$\pm$} 13 y, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) median [interquartile range] 21 [8\textendash 41] n/h).Interventions:N/A.Measurements and Results:In-laboratory cardiorespiratory polygraphy was used to assess OSA. CA activity was determined by an in vitro assay that quantifies the pH change reflecting the conversion of CO2 and H2O to HCO3- and H+. CA activity was positively associated with AHI and 4\% oxygen desaturation index (ODI4) (Spearman correlation r = 0.44 and 0.47, both P \&lt; 0.001). The associations (CA activity versus logAHI and CA versus logODI4) were independent of sex, age, body mass index, presleep oxygen saturation, nocturnal oxygen saturation, hypertension status, and use of diuretic medication in two generalized linear models (P = 0.007 and 0.011, respectively). Sitting diastolic blood pressure was associated with CA activity after adjustment of sex, age, body mass index, mean oxygen saturation, and AHI (P = 0.046).Conclusions:Carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity increased with apnea-hypopnea index and related nocturnal hypoxemia measures in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Altered CA activity may constitute a component that modulates respiratory control and hemodynamic regulation in patients with OSA.},

  abstract = {Four genes encode electroneutral, Na+-independent, K\textendash Cl cotransporters. KCC2, is exclusively expressed in neurons where it is thought to drive intracellular Cl- to low concentrations and shift the reversal potential for Cl- conductances such as GABAA or glycine receptor channels, thus participating in the postnatal development of inhibitory mechanisms in the brain. Indeed, expression of the cotransporter is low at birth and increases postnatally, at a time when the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons decreases and {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid switches its effect from excitatory to inhibitory. To assert the significance of KCC2 in neuronal function, we disrupted the mouse gene encoding this neuronal-specific K\textendash Cl cotransporter. We demonstrate that animals deficient in KCC2 exhibit frequent generalized seizures and die shortly after birth. We also show upregulation of Fos, the product of the immediate early gene c-fos, and the significant loss of parvalbumin-positive interneurons, both indicative of brain injury. The regions most affected are the hippocampus and temporal and entorhinal cortices. Extracellular field potential measurements in the CA1 hippocampus exhibited hyperexcitability. Application of picrotoxin, a blocker of the GABAA receptor, further increased hyperexcitability in homozygous hippocampal sections. Pharmacological treatment of pups showed that diazepam relieved the seizures while phenytoin prevented them between postnatal ages P4\textendash P12. Finally, we demonstrate that adult heterozygote animals show increased susceptibility for epileptic seizure and increased resistance to the anticonvulsant effect of propofol. Taken together, these results indicate that KCC2 plays an important role in controlling CNS excitability during both postnatal development and adult life.

  abstract = {Effects of various concentrations of CO2 on brain excitability and electrolyte distribution in rats were studied, and also some properties of seizures induced by abrupt withdrawal from high concentrations of CO2. Inhalation of relatively low concentrations of CO2 (5\textendash 20\%) decreases brain excitability, as measured by an increase in electroshock seizure threshold (EST). In moderately high concentrations (25\textendash 40\%), CO2 increases brain excitability, as measured by a decrease in EST and the appearance of spontaneous seizures. Inhalation of high concentration of CO2 (40\% or higher) markedly decreases brain excitability and causes anesthesia. Thus the effect of CO2 on brain excitability is related to the concentration inhaled. Abrupt removal of rats from high (anesthetic) concentrations of CO2 results in spontaneous clonic seizures within 30 seconds to 1 minute after withdrawal; these seizures last for 1\textendash 2 minutes. Inhalation of 50\% CO2 decreases brain intracellular Na and K concentrations and produces a marked cellular acidosis. Thirty seconds after abrupt withdrawal of rats from 50\% CO2, but prior to the onset of seizures, the concentration of Na in brain cells increases and the concentration of K decreases.},

Here we report that Drosophila neuropeptide F (dNPF), a human NPY homolog, coordinates larval behavioral changes during development. The brain expression of npf is high in larvae attracted to food, whereas its downregulation coincides with the onset of behaviors of older larvae, including food aversion, hypermobility, and cooperative burrowing. Loss of dNPF signaling in young transgenic larvae led to the premature display of behavioral phenotypes associated with older larvae. Conversely, dNPF overexpression in older larvae prolonged feeding, and suppressed hypermobility and cooperative burrowing behaviors. The dNPF system provides a new paradigm for studying the central control of cooperative behavior.},

This study investigates how an increase in blood CO2, via inhalation of 5\% CO2, may alter brain activity in humans. Dynamic measurement of brain metabolism revealed that mild hypercapnia resulted in a suppression of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) by 13.4\%{$\pm$}2.3\% (N=14) and, furthermore, the CMRO2 change was proportional to the subject's end-tidal CO2 (Et-CO2) change. When using functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) to assess the changes in resting-state neural activity, it was found that hypercapnia resulted in a reduction in all fcMRI indices assessed including cluster volume, cross-correlation coefficient, and amplitude of the fcMRI signal in the default-mode network (DMN). The extent of the reduction was more pronounced than similar indices obtained in visual-evoked fMRI, suggesting a selective suppression effect on resting-state neural activity. Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) studies comparing hypercapnia with normocapnia conditions showed a relative increase in low frequency power in the EEG spectra, suggesting that the brain is entering a low arousal state on CO2 inhalation.},

  abstract = {Heterocephalus glaber (the naked mole rat) is a highly social mammal, living in large underground colonies in equatorial Africa. Isolated naked mole rats exhibit unusual thermoregulation and cannot regulate body temperature (\$T\_\{b\}\$). Thermoregulatory parameters, namely Vo{$_2$}, evaporative water loss (EWL), and \$T\_\{b\}\$, were therefore examined when these animals were housed in groups ranging from two to eight animals. Oxygen consumption at low ambient temperatures (\$T\_\{a\},'s\$), irrespective of the experimental group size, increased with increasing \$T\_\{a\}\$ in a poikilothermic manner. Changes in Vo{$_2$} with increasing \$T\_\{a\}\$ switched to an endothermic pattern at \$T\_\{a\}'s\$ ranging from 25\textdegree C (for groups of eight) to 27\textdegree{} C (for pairs). Huddling behavior confers savings in both energy expenditure and evaporative water loss. These are most pronounced at high \$T\_\{a\} 's\$. For instance, at \$T\_\{a\}\$ = 32\textdegree{} C (within the "thermoneutral zone "), groups of eight animals use 78\% of the Vo{$_2$} and 69\% of EWL used by pairs. Body temperature of animals housed in pairs is directly proportional to \$T\_\{a\}\$ over the entire experimental \$T\_\{a\}\$ range (14\textdegree 37\textdegree{} C). Over the \$T\_\{a\}\$ range normally encountered in their warm equatorial burrows (29\textdegree{} -32\textdegree{} C), animals that were housed in groups of four or more tightly controlled \$T\_\{b\}\$ (within 1\textdegree{} C). Data presented here suggest that huddling behavior not only saves energy and water, so essential in an arid environment where food is sparsely distributed, but huddling also plays a very important thermoregulatory role in these otherwise nonendothermic mammals. Huddling ensures that, in their natural habitat, naked mole rats are able to control \$T\_\{b\}\$ and are indeed homeotherms.},

In this study, the full-length cDNA of the cytosolic carbonic anhydrase c isoform of G. przewalskii (GpCAc) was amplified and sequenced; mRNA levels and enzyme activity of GpCAc and blood chemistry were evaluated to understand the compensatory responses as the naked carp returned to the saline-alkaline lake after spawning. We found that GpCAc had a total length of 1400 bp and encodes a peptide of 260 amino acids. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences and phylogenetic analysis showed that GpCAc was a member of the cytosolic carbonic anhydrase II-like c family. Cytosolic-carbonic-anhydrase-c-specific primers were used to analyze the tissue distribution of GpCAc mRNA expression. Expression of GpCAc mRNA was found in brain, gill, liver, kidney, gut, and muscle tissues, but primarily in the gill and posterior kidney; however, none was evident in red blood cells. Transferring fish from river water to lake water resulted in a respiratory alkalosis, osmolality, and ion rise in the blood, as well as significant decreases in the expression and enzyme activity of GpCAc in both the gill and kidney within 96 h. These results indicate that GpCAc may play an important role in the acclimation to both high salinity and carbonate alkalinity. Specifically, G. przewalskii decreases cytosolic carbonic anhydrase c expression to compensate for a respiratory alkalosis and to aid in osmoregulation during the transition from river to saline-alkaline lake.;},

Thus, the Na+/K+/Cl- co-transporter (NKCC1), the K+/ Cl- co-transporter (KCC2), and the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor may represent therapeutic targets in stroke, but a time-dependent effect on neuronal viability could influence the outcome. We, therefore, successively blocked NKCC1, KCC2, and GABAA (with bumetanide, DIOA, and gabazine, respectively) or activated GABAA (with isoguvacine) either during or after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Primary hippocampal cultures were exposed to a 2-h OGD or sham normoxia treatment, and viability was determined using the resazurin assay. Neuronal viability was significantly reduced after OGD, and was further decreased by DIOA treatment applied during OGD (p {$<$} 0.01) and by gabazine applied after OGD (p {$<$} 0.05). Bumetanide treatment during OGD increased viability (p {$<$} 0.05), while isoguvacine applied either during or after OGD did not influence viability. Our data suggests that NKCC1 and KCC2 function has an important impact on neuronal viability during the acute ischemic episode, while the GABAA receptor plays a role during the subsequent recovery period. These findings suggest that pharmacological modulation of transmembrane chloride transport could be a promising approach during stroke and highlight the importance of the timing of treatment application in relation to ischemia-reoxygenation.},

In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), elevated CO2 is applied to derive stimulus-induced changes in the cerebral rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) by measuring cerebral blood flow and blood-oxygenation-level\textendash dependent (BOLD) signal. Such methods, however, assume that hypercapnia has no direct effect on CMRO2. In this study, we used combined intracortical recordings and fMRI in the visual cortex of anesthetized macaque monkeys to show that spontaneous neuronal activity is in fact significantly reduced by moderate hypercapnia. As expected, measurement of cerebral blood volume using an exogenous contrast agent and of BOLD signal showed that both are increased during hypercapnia. In contrast to this, spontaneous fluctuations of local field potentials in the beta and gamma frequency range as well as multiunit activity are reduced by {$\sim$}15\% during inhalation of 6\% CO2 (pCO2 = 56 mmHg). A strong tendency toward a reduction of neuronal activity was also found at CO2 inhalation of 3\% (pCO2 = 45 mmHg). This suggests that CMRO2 might be reduced during hypercapnia and caution must be exercised when hypercapnia is applied to calibrate the BOLD signal.},

  abstract = {The alkenone\textendash pCO2 methodology has been used to reconstruct the partial pressure of ancient atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO2) for the past 45 million years of Earth's history (Middle Eocene to Pleistocene epochs). The present long-term CO2 record is a composite of data from multiple ocean localities that express a wide range of oceanographic and algal growth conditions that potentially bias CO2 results. In this study, we present a pCO2 record spanning the past 40 million years from a single marine locality, Ocean Drilling Program Site 925 located in the western equatorial Atlantic Ocean. The trends and absolute values of our new CO2 record site are broadly consistent with previously published multi-site alkenone\textendash CO2 results. However, new pCO2 estimates for the Middle Miocene are notably higher than published records, with average pCO2 concentrations in the range of 400\textendash 500 ppm. Our results are generally consistent with recent pCO2 estimates based on boron isotope-pH data and stomatal index records, and suggest that CO2 levels were highest during a period of global warmth associated with the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum (17\textendash 14 million years ago, Ma), followed by a decline in CO2 during the Middle Miocene Climate Transition (approx. 14 Ma). Several relationships remain contrary to expectations. For example, benthic foraminiferal {$\delta$}18O records suggest a period of deglaciation and/or high-latitude warming during the latest Oligocene (27\textendash 23 Ma) that, based on our results, occurred concurrently with a long-term decrease in CO2 levels. Additionally, a large positive {$\delta$}18O excursion near the Oligocene\textendash Miocene boundary (the Mi-1 event, approx. 23 Ma), assumed to represent a period of glacial advance and retreat on Antarctica, is difficult to explain by our CO2 record alone given what is known of Antarctic ice sheet history and the strong hysteresis of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet once it has grown to continental dimensions. We also demonstrate that in the Neogene with low CO2 levels, algal carbon concentrating mechanisms and spontaneous biocarbonate\textendash CO2 conversions are likely to play a more important role in algal carbon fixation, which provides a potential bias to the alkenone\textendash pCO2 method.},

  abstract = {Damaraland mole rats (DMRs, Fukomys damarensis) are a eusocial fossorial species that spend the majority of their life in densely populated underground burrows, in which they likely experience intermittent periods of elevated CO2 (i.e. hypercapnia). The primary physiological response to hypercapnia in most mammals is to increase depth and rate of breathing (i.e. hyperpnoea), but this response is often blunted in species that inhabit hypercapnic environments. In their natural habitat, DMRs putatively experience a gaseous environment ranging from normocapnic (0.1\% CO2) to hypercapnic (6.0\% CO2) conditions (Roper et al. 2001 J. Zool.254, 101\textendash 107). As such, we hypothesized that DMRs would exhibit blunted hypercapnic ventilatory and metabolic responses, relative to those of non-fossorial rodent species. To test this hypothesis, we exposed awake, freely behaving DMRs to normoxic normocapnia (21\% O2, 0\% CO2, balance N2) or graded normoxic hypercapnia (21\% O2, 0, 2, 5, 7 and 10\% CO2, balance N2), and measured ventilation and metabolism using whole-body plethysmography and indirect calorimetry, respectively. We found that ventilation and metabolism were unchanged during prolonged normocapnia, whereas during graded hypercapnia, ventilation was elevated at 2\% CO2 and above. As a result, O2 extraction efficiency at the lungs decreased with increasing hyperpnoea. Conversely, metabolic rate did not increase until 10\% CO2, presumably due to the metabolic cost of hyperpnoea. Taken together, our results suggest that despite their fossorial lifestyle, DMRs do not exhibit adaptations in their ventilatory or metabolic responses to environmental hypercapnia.},

  abstract = {African naked mole-rats were likely the first mammals to evolve eusociality, and thus required adaptations to conserve energy and tolerate the low oxygen (O2) and high carbon dioxide (CO2) of a densely populated fossorial nest. As hypercapnia is known to suppress neuronal activity, we studied whether naked mole-rats might demonstrate energy savings in GABAergic inhibition. Using whole-colony behavioral monitoring of captive naked mole-rats, we found a durable nest, characterized by high CO2 levels, where all colony members spent the majority of their time. Analysis of the naked mole-rat genome revealed, uniquely among mammals, a histidine point variation in the neuronal potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2). A histidine missense substitution mutation at this locus in the human ortholog of KCC2, found previously in patients with febrile seizures and epilepsy, has been demonstrated to diminish neuronal Cl\`A extrusion capacity, and thus impairs GABAergic inhibition. Seizures were observed, without pharmacological intervention, in adult naked mole-rats exposed to a simulated hyperthermic surface environment, causing systemic hypocapnic alkalosis. Consistent with the diminished function of KCC2, adult naked mole-rats demonstrate a reduced efficacy of inhibition that manifests as triggering of seizures at room temperature by the GABAA receptor (GABAAR) positive allosteric modulator diazepam. These seizures are blocked in the presence of nest-like levels of CO2 and likely to be mediated through GABAAR activity, based on in vitro recordings. Thus, altered GABAergic inhibition adds to a growing list of adaptations in the naked mole-rat and provides a plausible proximate mechanism for nesting behavior, where a return to the colony nest restores GABA-mediated inhibition.},

  abstract = {Hypoxia results in both reversible and irreversible changes in the brain extracellular space (ECS). This study utilized microdialysis to monitor changes in the energy-related metabolites lactate, pyruvate, glucose and glutamate in the rat cortex before, during and after 30-min transient global hypoxia, induced in anesthetized rats by reducing inspired oxygen to 6\% O2 in nitrogen. Changes in metabolite levels were compared with ECS diffusion parameters calculated from diffusion curves of tetramethylammonium applied by iontophoresis. Significant increases in lactate concentration and the lactate/pyruvate ratio, as well as decreased glucose levels, were found in the cortex immediately after the induction of hypoxia. Following recovery to ventilation with air, extracellular lactate and glucose levels and the lactate/pyruvate ratio returned to control levels within 40, 20 and 30~min, respectively. Glutamate levels started to increase 20\textendash 30~min after the onset of hypoxia and returned to prehypoxic values within 30\textendash 40~min of reoxygenation. The ECS volume fraction {$\alpha$} decreased by about 5\% from 0.18{$\pm$}0.01 during the first 20\textendash 25~min of hypoxia; after 25~min {$\alpha$} dropped a further 22\% to 0.14{$\pm$}0.01. Within 10~min of reoxygenation, {$\alpha$} returned to control values, then increased to 0.20{$\pm$}0.01 and remained at this level until the end of the experiment. The observed 22\% decrease in {$\alpha$} markedly influences dialysate levels measured during hypoxia. In our study, the complete posthypoxic recovery of cortical metabolite levels and ECS diffusion properties suggests that metabolic enzymes and related cellular components (e.g., mitochondria) may tolerate prolonged hypoxic periods and recover to prehypoxic values.},
